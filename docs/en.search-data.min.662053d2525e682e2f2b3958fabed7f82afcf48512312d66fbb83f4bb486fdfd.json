It is one of the Hanzi dictionary databases comprising the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (abbreviated as HDIC). The terms \u0026lsquo;kanji\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hanzi\u0026rsquo; are explained later.\nThe Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myogisho is a Hanzi dictionary compiled in the twelfth century by a Shingon Buddhist monk. It has been regarded as an important resource for Japanese historical linguistics research due to its extensive collection of wakun indicating accent, detailed annotations on Hanzi pronunciations, and annotations on variant characters. Furthermore, its Chinese annotations on fanqie, meanings, and glyph forms have also garnered attention as materials for Chinese linguistics.\nIt was first published in March 2022, and in March 2025, a revised edition with specification changes and detailed explanations will be released.\nKanji and Hanzi To bridge the gap between \u0026lsquo;Kanji\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hanzi,\u0026rsquo; and to facilitate international academic discourse, the following supplementary explanation may be useful:\nDictionaries of Chinese characters compiled in Japan during the Heian period are invaluable resources not only for the study of Japanese linguistics but also for the study of Chinese linguistics. To promote international accessibility, we propose using the term \u0026lsquo;Hanzi.\u0026rsquo; Researchers specializing in Japanese studies may, without any issue, read this term as \u0026lsquo;Kanji.\u0026rsquo; This approach aims to respect the linguistic diversity and academic traditions of both fields, while encouraging broader scholarly exchange.\nThis explanation aims to provide clarity and respect for both terminologies, ensuring that researchers from different backgrounds can engage with the material without linguistic barriers.\nFor these reasons, \u0026lsquo;hanzi\u0026rsquo; is used for the column names of the public data, while \u0026lsquo;kanji\u0026rsquo; is used in the explanatory text.\nData Files List and Brief Description The data from the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myogisho, published at https://github.com/shikeda/HDIC/tree/master/v1.2, is as follows. This includes some files that are currently being prepared for public release.\n krm_main: Basic data.

Previously, the published files were prefixed with \u0026ldquo;KRM,\u0026rdquo; but the files following this specification change will be prefixed with \u0026ldquo;krm.\u0026rdquo;\nThe files incorporating the specification changes have been placed in the \u0026ldquo;v1.2\u0026rdquo; folder. Please note that this is a temporary arrangement.\nHere are the key points of the specification change:\n The at mark \u0026ldquo;@\u0026quot;, which indicates that kana wakun does not have tone marks, has been changed to an underscore \u0026ldquo;_\u0026quot;. The double quotation mark \u0026ldquo;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, which indicates that voiced sound wakun has tone marks, has been changed to a half-width English letter \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;. The half-width parentheses \u0026ldquo;()\u0026quot;, which indicate the presence of tone marks, have been changed to full-width parentheses \u0026ldquo;（）\u0026quot;.

The book title is read as \u0026ldquo;ruiju myōgishō.\u0026rdquo; It is said that the title was formed by taking \u0026ldquo;Ruiju\u0026rdquo; from Minamoto no Shitagō\u0026rsquo;s Wamyō Ruijushō and \u0026ldquo;Myōgi\u0026rdquo; from Kūkai\u0026rsquo;s Tenrei Banshō Myōgi.\nHere, we will first describe the outline of the Ruiju Myōgishō and its various versions. Next, regarding the Kanchi-in manuscript, which is the only extant complete manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō, we will explain the structure of its entries, and then describe the details of the input method for the text of the Kanchi-in manuscript.\nNote that while the explanation provided here overlaps in part with what is stated in the paper by Ikeda Shoju, Liu Guanwei, Jun Munho, Zhang Xinfang, and Li Yuan, “Full-text Database of Ruiju Myogi-sho, Kanchi-in MS : A Look at Development Methods and Calculating the Number of Headwords.\u0026rdquo; (Kuntengo to Kuten Shiryō 144, 2020), it has been completely overhauled and rewritten by the first author, Ikeda, who organized the terminology and substantially added subsequent research findings.\nContents  Overview Overview of Public Data  krm_main krm_notes krm_headword_chars krm_wakun　 krm_definitions　 krm_pronunciations　 krm_ndl　   Entry Data Model  Entry Data Structure Types of Entries Concepts Related to Character Notation Entry Data Fiels   Item Data Entry  Head Characters, Entry Structure, and ID System Character Encoding and Representation Problems and Handling in Writing, Notation, and Annotations   Basic Policy for Annotation Creation  Basic Policy and Subjects of Analysis for Annotation Creation Calculation of Headword Count Types and Notation Formats of Character Form Notes Types and Decipherment Problems of Pronunciation Notes Types and Quantity of Meaning Notes Basic Materials for Wakun Annotation Concrete Examples of Annotation Description   Typesetting Settings for Transcriptions and Annotations  Hanazono Mincho Settings GlyphWiki Settings sfkanbun.sty Settings VS Code and TeX Live Online Tools   Project Progress Historical Research on Japanese: A Case Study of the KRM Manuscript  Database Construction Process The Ruiju Myōgishō of the Kanchi-in manuscript is an old handwritten manuscript, and because it contains an extremely large number of difficult characters, we proceeded with database construction using the following steps.\nStep 1: Scan the facsimile edition and cut out each listed character to create an image database of the Ruiju Myōgishō of the Kanchi-in manuscript. The image files of the listed characters are named according to the location of the listed character. This image file name will later be used as the listed character ID.\nStep 2: Add the location information to the existing Tenrei Banshō Myōgi database by referring to the \u0026ldquo;Kanji Index\u0026rdquo; included in Atsuo Masamune\u0026rsquo;s Ruiju Myōgishō Volume 2 (Kazama Shobō, 1955). Input the location information from the \u0026ldquo;Kanji Index\u0026rdquo; into the Tenrei Banshō Myōgishō data rearranged in the order of the Dai Kanwa Jiten index numbers compiled by Tetsuji Morohashi. Then, rearrange it according to the order of locations in the Kanchi-in manuscript, collate it with the text of the Kanchi-in manuscript, and add the page numbers and character order of the Kanchi-in manuscript that are not found in the \u0026ldquo;Kanji Index.\u0026rdquo;\nStep 3: Take in various information included in the Tenrei Banshō Myōgishō database (Dai Kanwa Jiten index numbers, Unicode numbers, kanji characters, location information in the Tenrei Banshō Myōgishō) and the corresponding location information of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript created in Step 2, into the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database (created in Step 1) to create an input database for the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text.\nStep 4: While referring to the facsimile edition of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript (Tenri Library Rare Books Series, Japanese Books Section, Volumes 32-34) and the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database, add the text information for the listed characters and their explanations (\u0026ldquo;chūmon/chūbun\u0026rdquo;) to the input database for the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text created in Step 3.\nStep 5: Integrate the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database and the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text database to form the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript database. Then, check and revise the text content using the newly published color facsimile edition of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript (New Tenri Library Rare Books Series, Volumes 9-11). When checking the text content, also distinguish between compound word entries and variant character entries in the listed items, and distinguish between font annotations, pronunciation annotations, meaning annotations, and Japanese glosses in the explanations, and add this information.\nStep 6: Publish the completed Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript database on the internet and provide a search service.\nOnline Information Provision HDIC\u0026rsquo;s online information provision consists of three parts: the main site, the search screen, and the text data. The main site is available at the following URL and summarizes the overview of the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (HDIC) (in Japanese, Chinese, and English), a list of research results, links to related sites, etc. https://hdic.jp\nThe search screen is available at the following URL, where you can use the HDIC Viewer to search the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (HDIC). The HDIC Viewer is maintained and managed by Liu Guanwei and allows searches not only on personal computers but also on smartphones. https://viewer.hdic.jp\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Tomohiko Morioka for his technical support in maintaining and managing the hdic.jp website.\nThe text data is available at the following URL, where we publish the text files created by the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (HDIC).\nWe preserve records of data revisions and provide the latest versions of the full-text databases for the Song Dynasty edition of the Yupian, the Kozanji manuscript of the Tenrei Banshō Myōgi, and the Tenji manuscript of the Shinsen Jikyō.\nhttps://github.com/shikeda/HDIC\nThe Ruiju Myōgishō of the Kanchi-in manuscript underwent a specification change in March 2025, and the latest version of its full-text database is available at the following URL:\nhttps://github.com/shikeda/HDIC/tree/master/v1.2\nPlease note that the above URLs are subject to change in the future. Maintaining and managing the constructed data is a significant challenge.\nAcknowledgements The construction and publication of the full-text database of the Ruiju Myōgishō of the Kanchi-in manuscript are being carried out with special permission from the authorities of Tenri Library, and we have also received exceptional consideration from Yagi Shoten, the publisher of the Tenri Library Rare Books Series.

The manuscript in question was introduced in 1950 as the Zushoryō manuscript (Library of Ancient Books manuscript).\nThe redacted lineage, alternatively termed the kaihenbon-kei (redacted version lineage) or Kōekibon tradition, includes several known manuscripts: the Kanchi-in manuscript, the Kōzan-ji manuscript, the Renshō-in manuscript, the Sainen-ji manuscript, and the Hōbodai-in manuscript. Of these, only the Kanchi-in manuscript survives in complete form; the remaining examples are fragmentary or incomplete. The redacted tradition has been the subject of sustained scholarly inquiry since the Edo period, beginning with the work of Ban Nobutomo and others.\nIn Japanese scholarship, it is common practice to refer to individual manuscripts by appending -bon (meaning “copy” or “text”) to the name of the holding temple or institution—for example, Kanchiin-bon. In this paper, however, these will be referred to using the English term “manuscript” for clarity and consistency.\nIn contemporary scholarship, the work is frequently referred to in abbreviated form as the Myōgishō.\nCompiler The compiler of the original compilation is presumed to have been a Buddhist scholar-monk affiliated with the Hossō school, or possibly trained in both the Hossō and Shingon traditions, though their identity remains unknown. The compiler of the redacted version is likewise unidentified but is generally believed to have been a Shingon scholar-monk. A long-standing theory attributing the work to Sugawara no Koreyoshi is now considered erroneous.\nDate of Compilation The sole extant exemplar of the original compilation—the Zushoryō manuscript—is a fragment of a single fascicle categorized under the Dharma section (hōbu), referring to one of the traditional Buddhist categories corresponding to the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).\nAlthough it bears no colophon or scribal note, it is generally dated to the Insei (cloistered rule) period. The text makes reference to the monk Eichō Sōzu (Eichō, Bishop), who is known to have received the title Sōzu in 1081 (Eihō 1). Based on this and other circumstantial evidence, the work is believed to have been compiled by around the year 1000.\nAs for the redacted version, a manuscript from Kōzan-ji contains a marginal note in the hand of the Kōyasan monk Genshō, dated to 1178 (Jishō 2). Since this note corresponds to content found in the redacted Ruiju Myōgishō, it is inferred that the revised compilation had been completed by that time.\nSignificance The work lists Chinese characters both as individual graphs and compounds, accompanied by fanqie spellings, homophone glosses, katakana transcriptions for Sino-Japanese readings, literary Chinese definitions, native Japanese readings (wakun) in katakana, and annotations indicating orthographic variants such as “standard” and “popular” forms. Phonetic marks (shōten) are sometimes added to both the Sino-Japanese and native readings.\nRadical Structure According to the Kanchi-in manuscript, the Ruiju Myōgishō is organized into 120 sections grouped under the three divisions of the Buddhist Triratna: Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧). Each division contains 40 sections based on semantic radicals. The table below presents the full list of radicals used, shown with their associated head characters (部首字).\nBuddha Division (仏)\n(Upper Volume)\n1 人 2 彳 3 辵 4 匚 5 走 6 麦 7 一 8 丨 9 十 10 身\n(Middle Volume)\n11 耳 12 女 13 舌 14 口 15 目 16 鼻 17 見 18 日 19 田 20 肉\n(Lower Volume, Part 1)\n21 舟 22 骨 23 角 24 貝 25 頁 26 彡 27 髟 28 手 29 木 30 犬\n(Lower Volume, Part 2)\n31 牛 32 片 33 豸 34 乙 35 儿 36 𠬞 37 八 38 大 39 火 40 黒\nDharma Division (法)\n(Upper Volume)\n41 水 42 冫 43 言 44 足 45 立 46 豆 47 卜 48 面 49 歯 50 山\n(Middle Volume)\n51 石 52 玉 53 色 54 邑 55 阜 56 土 57 心 58 巾 59 糸 60 衣\n(Lower Volume)\n61 示 62 禾 63 米 64 丶 65 宀 66 勹 67 穴 68 雨 69 門 70 口 71 尸 72 虍 73 广 74 鹿 75 疒 76 歹 77 子 78 斗 79 倝 80 寸\nSangha Division (僧)\n(Upper Volume)\n81 艸 82 竹 83 力 84 刀 85 羽 86 毛 87 食 88 金\n(Middle Volume)\n89 亼 90 爪 91 网 92 皿 93 瓦 94 缶 95 弓 96 㫃 97 矢 98 斤 99 矛 100 戈 101 欠 102 又 103 攴 104 殳 105 皮 106 革 107 韋 108 車 109 羊 110 馬 111 鳥 112 隹\n(Lower Volume)\n113 魚 114 虫 115 鼠 116 亀 117 鬼 118 風 119 酉 120 雑\nNote on Organization:\nThe radical system employed in the Ruiju Myōgishō follows the structure of the Yùpiān (『玉篇』) compiled by Liang dynasty scholar Gu Yewang, which comprises 542 sections. Radicals of similar form were grouped together (e.g., integrating 彳 and 行 under a single radical), while those with fewer entries were consolidated into the final miscellaneous section (雑).\nAdditionally, the ordering of radicals reflects both semantic grouping (e.g., parts of the body, food, clothing, animals, plants, etc.) and visual similarity of character shapes. For example, the 女 radical follows 耳, and 言 follows 冫, likely because the cursive or semi-cursive forms of 耳 and 言 resemble 女 and 冫, respectively.\nNumber of Entries The term entry refers to a unit consisting of both the headword and its accompanying original glosses. To provide a general sense of the scope of the Ruiju Myōgishō, we may look to the Kanchi-in manuscript for a representative overview. The following table presents a summary of the number of entries, the number of individual headwords, and the number of compound expressions found in each of the ten volumes, from the Buddha (Upper) through the Sangha (Lower) sections.\nTable: Number of Entries, Characters, and Compound Expressions by Volume (Kanchi-in Manuscript)\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of character entries across the ten volumes of the Ruiju Myōgishō as preserved in the Kanchi-in manuscript. The work is structured into three main sections—Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧)—each comprising multiple volumes. The entries are classified by the number of characters per expression (from single-character to seven or more), along with totals for entries, characters, and compound expressions.\n   Volume 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6-char 7+ char Total Entries Total Characters Compound Expressions     Buddha (Upper) 1,650 469 53 13 3 2 2 2,192 2,840 329   Buddha (Middle) 3,123 573 55 20 9 1 5 3,786 4,620 325   Buddha (Lower 1) 3,027 679 100 13 5 2 2 3,828 4,790 417   Buddha (Lower 2) 1,287 264 28 9 1 1 2 1,592 1,963 140   Dharma (Upper) 3,054 437 61 8 4 3 5 3,572 4,226 213   Dharma (Middle) 3,623 622 61 15 7 3 4 4,335 5,195 310   Dharma (Lower) 2,721 760 134 10 5 2 7 3,639 4,774 416   Sangha (Upper) 2,226 1,100 185 24 6 4 1 3,546 5,139 635   Sangha (Middle) 1,974 939 133 23 4 3 2 3,078 4,397 386   Sangha (Lower) 1,996 829 167 30 6 4 7 3,039 4,396 409   Total 24,681 6,672 977 165 50 25 37 32,607 42,340 3,580    Sources Original Compilation\nThe Zushoryō manuscript of the original compilation, though fragmentary and classified under the Hōbu-jō (Department of Dharma: Upper) section, is distinguished by its faithful citation of a wide range of texts, including bibliographic and authorial attributions. It is widely utilized as a vital source in the study of the history of the Japanese language.\nThe manuscript contains 3,657 entries in total, of which 951 are single-character headwords; the remainder are compound expressions. The majority of these compounds are derived from Buddhist glossaries such as Xuanying’s Yiqiejing yinyi, Shingō’s Daihannyakyō onkun, Chūzan’s Myōhōrengekyō shakumon, and works attributed to Cien.\nBeyond Buddhist phonetic commentaries, many entries are drawn from classical lexica such as Gu Yewang’s Yupian, Kūkai’s Tenrei banshō meigi, Sugawara no Koreyoshi’s Tōkyū setsuin, and Minamoto no Shitagō’s Wamyō ruijushō.\nThe citations from these sources follow a fixed order of precedence: in semantic annotations written in literary Chinese, sacred Buddhist texts (naiten) are prioritized over secular Chinese or native Japanese texts (geten). The Japanese glosses (wakun) are based on annotated editions (kuntenbon) of secular literature. Diacritical tone marks (shōten) are applied with precision, offering valuable information about vocabulary and pitch accent in the Heian period. These tone marks also appear in the phonetic annotations of Chinese characters—such as fanqie, homophonic glosses, and katakana transcriptions—making the manuscript an important resource for the study of Sino-Japanese phonology.\nRevised Compilation\nThe Kanchi-in manuscript of the revised compilation—also known as the Kaihenbon or Kōekibon—contains approximately 32,000 headword entries and about 34,000 Japanese native readings (wakun). Of these, roughly 10,000 wakun are annotated with diacritical tone marks (shōten). The names of authors and titles of cited sources found in the original compilation have been removed, and many of the semantic glosses in literary Chinese have likewise been omitted. Wakun originally recorded in man’yōgana have been replaced with katakana.\nThere is a substantial expansion of single-character entries. For items carried over from the original compilation, wakun have been added and reorganized; for new entries introduced in the revised version, a large number of wakun have been supplemented as well, resulting in a significantly enlarged corpus of Japanese glosses.\nThe annotations on graphic variants (itaiji), “standard” and “popular” forms (sei/zoku), and the phonetic readings of characters in both Han and Wu pronunciations constitute a major resource for the study of Japanese linguistic history.\nWithin each radical category, headword entries are often arranged either by visual similarity or according to the character ordering found in the Yupian—referred to here as the Gyokuhen jijun-gun (“Yupian character order groups”).\nAlthough only the Hōbu-jō (Upper Dharma) section of the original compilation survives, comparison between the original and revised versions reveals the nature of additions and editorial changes. For sections no longer extant in the original compilation, it is possible to identify underlying textual sources by cross-referencing with the principal reference works that were extensively cited in the original. Of particular importance are frequently referenced texts such as Yiqiejing yinyi, Tenrei banshō meigi, and Wamyō ruijushō, all of which remain extant in complete form. These sources should be consistently consulted when interpreting the revised compilation.\nFacsimile Original Compilation Zushoryō Manuscript\nFormerly held in the collection of the Shimizudani Kimiyasu family and currently preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency (Kunai-chō Shoryōbu), this manuscript was first published in 1950 as a facsimile edition titled Zushoryōbon Ruiju Myōgishō, retaining its original Japanese-style binding. The edition includes an introductory essay by Hashimoto Fumio and is available for viewing via the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nA Western-style bound edition was reissued in 1969, followed by a revised edition in 1976 featuring a complete set of indices—for sources, kana glosses, and Chinese characters—accompanied by commentary by Tsukishima Hiroshi, a kana index by Miyazawa Toshimasa, and a kanji index by Sakai Kenji.\nThe extant portion of the manuscript corresponds to the Hōbu jōge (“Upper” and “Lower” Dharma sections), specifically the upper volume (jōsatsu), which covers 20 radicals out of a total of 40 in this section. It is generally believed that the full compilation originally consisted of two volumes each for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha sections. The character “五” (“5”) inscribed in the upper right corner of the cover suggests that this volume was originally the fifth in the full six-volume set.\nOn March 26, 2025, a color version of the manuscript was made publicly available via the Shoryōbu Catalog and Image Database of the Archives and Mausolea Department.\nRevised Compilation Kanchi-in Manuscript\nOriginally housed at Tō-ji’s Kanchi-in, this complete manuscript—consisting of one volume of section headings and ten volumes of main text—is now preserved at the Tenri Central Library. According to colophons, it was copied by Jinen in 1241 (Ninji 2) and later recopied by Kenkei in 1251 (Kenchō 3).\nSeveral facsimile and reproduction editions exist. The commonly cited versions are listed below, followed by brief descriptions:\n  Kichōtosho Edition (1937): A collotype facsimile edition in its original format, published by the Kichōtosho Fukuseikai, with commentary by Yamada Yoshio.

Copied in the late Kamakura to early Muromachi period, it is also referred to as the Chinkoku Shukoku Shrine Manuscript.\nIt comprises: Volume 1 (corresponding to Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū in the Kanchi-in Manuscript); Volume 2 (covering up to mid-Hō-jō); and Volume 3 (corresponding to Sō). A facsimile edition was issued in 1965 by the Mikkan Kokubun Shiryō Kankōkai under the title Sanpō Ruiju Myōgishō, with commentary by Ozaki Satoakira. A clearer reproduction was issued in 1986 by Benseisha.\nKōsan-ji Manuscript\nFormerly held at Kōsan-ji and now preserved at the Tenri Central Library via the Hōrei Collection. This manuscript was copied during the Insei period (late Heian).\nIt consists of two fragmentary volumes corresponding to Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū of the Kanchi-in Manuscript. The first folio lists section headings under the title Sanbō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō, and the main text begins with Butsuhō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō I / Section 1: Jin. This corresponds to the entry in the Kōsan-ji Shōgyō Mokuroku (Kenchō Inventory), which records Sanpō Ruiji-shū as a six-volume work. In 2016, a high-resolution color facsimile was published as Vol. 8 of the Shin Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho, with commentary by Yamamoto Hideto.\nSainen-ji Manuscript\nA one-volume fragment transcribed in 1767 (Meiwa 4), based on the Eissatsu Manuscript, preserving portions of Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū. Now held by both the Tenri Central Library and Kansai University. Although no printed facsimile exists, images of the Kansai University copy are publicly available.\nA version preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency is also accessible and more closely resembles the Tenri copy than the Kansai University one. While the Tenri copy has often been used in prior scholarship, the lack of a published facsimile once required researchers to visit the library to obtain photographic reproductions. The Shoryōbu copy now allows readers to access the same textual content as the Tenri Sainen-ji Manuscript.\nHōbodai-in Manuscript\nA one-volume fragment covering the “Ship” (舟) through “Dog” (犬) sections of Butsu-ge in the Kanchi-in Manuscript, likely copied in the late Kamakura period.\nA facsimile edition was published in 2002 by Taishō University Press, with commentary by Kurashima Tokihisa. A wakun index compiled by the same scholar was published in 2006 by the same press.\nIndexes Kanji Indexes\n  Masamune Atsuo (ed.), Ruiju Myōgishō, Vol. 2: Kanji Index \u0026amp; Kana Index, Kazama Shobō, 1955.\n  Nagashima Toyotarō (ed.), Composite Index to Old Character Dictionaries (2 vols.), Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, 1958–1959.\n  Wakun (Japanese Reading) Indexes\n  Masamune Atsuo (ed.), Ruiju Myōgishō: Kana Index, Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, 1939–1940.

The krm_headword_chars data file lists all headwords from the Myōgishō, ordered according to the sequence of items in the Myōgishō and by the order of appearance of characters within each item.\nIn the Myōgishō database, the primary data file krm_main, as well as the annotation data krm_notes and the wakun data krm_wakun, are all structured on an item-by-item basis. Consequently, for headwords composed of multiple characters, any character subsequent to the first cannot be directly referenced from these particular data files.\nTo search for headwords from the Myōgishō character by character, display their original manuscript images, or perform analyses at the individual character level, a complete list of all headword characters, including those from the second character onwards in multi-character compounds, is necessary.\nThe krm_headword_chars data file was created for this purpose. This data is provided in TSV and JSON formats. Each row (or entry) corresponds to a single headword character and includes information such as: the sequential ID of the headword (single or multi-character) in the Myōgishō to which the character belongs (hanzi_id), the ID of the Myōgishō item to which this character\u0026rsquo;s headword belongs (entry_id), the order of the character within its headword entry (character_order), the character itself (constituent_char), the file name of the individually cropped image for the character (img_file_name), and location information for that character in both the Kazama and Tenri editions (kazama_location_id, tenri_location_id). This enables information access at the individual character level while allowing linkage with item-based data files such as krm_main.\nThe column names and their descriptions for krm_headword_chars are as follows:\n   Column Name English Explanation     hanzi_id A sequential ID assigned to each headword (single or multi-character) in the order of its appearance in the Myōgishō. It consists of a 5-digit numeric ID starting with \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo;.   entry_id A heading item ID (from krm_main) to which this character\u0026rsquo;s headword belongs, formed by a 5-digit numeric ID starting with \u0026lsquo;F\u0026rsquo;. For some added entry items, a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix is appended.   constituent_char The constituent character itself. Abbreviation marks (ー) and iteration marks (〻) are converted to the actual characters they represent. Collated characters are, in principle, Kangxi Dictionary forms; the handling of Unicode new character forms (common-use forms, popular variants) is specified separately. For detailed collation notes, refer to krm_notes.   character_order Indicates the numerical order of appearance of the character within its headword entry.   kazama_location_id An ID indicating the location of this character in the Kazama Edition: K + Volume (2 digits) + Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character Order in Segment (1 digit).   tenri_location_id An ID indicating the location of this character in the Tenri Edition: T + Volume (a/b/c) + Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character Order in Segment (1 digit).   img_file_name File name of the headword character image (including the .jpg extension). The main part of the file name consists of a 7-digit number for images from Volume 1 to Volume 9, and an 8-digit number for images from Volume 10. For 7-digit numbers, the first digit indicates the volume number; for 8-digit numbers, the first two digits indicate Volume 10.

"},{"id":7,"href":"/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-04-wakun/","title":"krm_wakun","section":"Overview of Published Data","content":"krm_wakun This data is derived by extracting wakun from the KRM.tsv file of the Myōgishō database, organizing variant forms of the wakun, and adjusting their correspondence with variant characters (itai-ji).\nCollation and textual research related to wakun are documented in krm_notes, so they are omitted here.\nIn wakun, different readings may be written alongside the main reading as annotations.\nFor example, the wakun \u0026ldquo;マサル\u0026rdquo; (masaru) is assigned to the character \u0026ldquo;倍\u0026rdquo; (bai), but \u0026ldquo;su\u0026rdquo; is written in small katakana to the right of \u0026ldquo;ル\u0026rdquo; (ru) as an annotation. This indicates that the wakun \u0026ldquo;マス\u0026rdquo; (masu) is annotated in addition to \u0026ldquo;マサル\u0026rdquo; (masaru).\nSince information from the JapanKnowledge version of the Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (Second Edition) will be added to the wakun, it is necessary to accommodate cases where variant forms of wakun are written together.\nThe handling of variant characters involves cases where variant forms are indicated for the head character, and this data has been adjusted to account for them.\nFor example, the wakun \u0026ldquo;yatsukare\u0026rdquo; appears in the definition for the head characters \u0026ldquo;㒒/僕\u0026rdquo;. The wakun \u0026ldquo;yatsukare\u0026rdquo; is a wakun for \u0026ldquo;僕\u0026rdquo; (boku) and is simultaneously a wakun for \u0026ldquo;㒒\u0026rdquo;. The relationship between standard and variant forms such as \u0026ldquo;爲\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;為\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;來\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;来\u0026rdquo; is similar.\nThe JapanKnowledge version of the Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (Second Edition) has a \u0026ldquo;Notation\u0026rdquo; field that includes the kanji notations from the Myōgishō, so this adjustment is a measure to ensure correspondence with it.\nTo explicitly indicate that these are the filenames after the specification change in March 2025, lowercase \u0026ldquo;krm\u0026rdquo; was used instead of uppercase \u0026ldquo;KRM,\u0026rdquo; resulting in the names krm_wakun.tsv and krm_wakun.json.\u0026rdquo;\nThe comparison of the new and old column names is as follows:\n   New Column Name (v1.2.0) Old Column Name (v1.1.97)     wakun_id KRID_wakun_no   definition_seq_id KRID_no   kazama_entry_location KR2ID   hanzi_entry Entry   wakun_elements Def   wakun_form Word_form   wakun_standard_hanzi Wakun_Hanzi   wakun_variant_in_hanzi Wakun_variant   variant_hanzi_for_wakun Hanzi_variant   japan_knowledge_id JK_URL   - Remarks    Remarks have been omitted and will be summarized in the following krm_notes file.\nNext, the content of the column names will be explained.\n   New Column Name (v1.2.0) Explanation     wakun_id Wakun ID, extracted from kr_definition_sequence_id, containing only entries where the type of order is Japanese reading (wakun).
