An Entry is the basic unit of the dictionary, typically consisting of a Headword and its associated Original Glosses.\nIn the Myōgishō, the Headword of an Entry consists of either a single Chinese character or multiple Chinese characters (a multi-character compound).\nEntries are presented in two forms based on their Headwords:\nSingle Character Form: When the Headword is a single Chinese character. Multi-Character Form: When the Headword consists of multiple Chinese characters. Multi-Character Form Entries include those for idioms (or compounds) and those that co-list variant characters (itaiji).\nBelow are some examples of these two forms:\nExamples:\nSingle Character Form: 人, 何 Multi-Character Form (idioms/compounds): 一人, 二人, 何如, 如何 Multi-Character Form (co-listing variant characters (itaiji)): 爲為, 羱𦍘 The distinction between Multi-Character Form Entries for idioms/compounds and those co-listing variant characters (itaiji) is determined by the content of the Original Glosses. For example, in \u0026lsquo;爲為\u0026rsquo;, which co-lists variant characters (itaiji), the Original Glosses contain the Form Classification Tag \u0026lsquo;正今\u0026rsquo; (sei kin). This indicates that \u0026lsquo;爲\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; (sei) form and \u0026lsquo;為\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;current/modern\u0026rsquo; (kin) form, thus establishing their relationship as variants. Similarly, for \u0026lsquo;羱𦍘\u0026rsquo;, the Original Glosses contain the Form Classification Tag \u0026lsquo;正俗\u0026rsquo; (sei zoku), indicating that \u0026lsquo;羱\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; (sei) form and \u0026lsquo;𦍘\u0026rsquo; is the \u0026lsquo;popular/vulgar\u0026rsquo; (zoku) form, confirming their variant relationship.\nPrinciples and Exceptions in the Arrangement of Entries # A single page in the Myōgishō is typically composed of 8 lines (rows) and 4 segments (columns per line). In other words, each page has a layout of 8 vertical lines and 4 horizontal segments, totaling 32 cells (or blocks) for entries.\nThe overwhelming majority of Entries are \u0026ldquo;single-segment, single-entry\u0026rdquo; (一段一項目, ichidan ikkōmoku), meaning one Entry is written within a single cell.\nWhen an explanation (i.e., the Original Glosses) is lengthy, it may occupy two or more cells, extending over multiple segments or multiple lines. Such \u0026ldquo;multi-segment, single-entry\u0026rdquo; (多段一項目, tadan ikkōmoku) instances also appear frequently. However, even with lengthy explanations, an Entry never extends beyond a single page. Thus, the general principle is that a single cell contains one Entry or less.\nAs an exception, two Entries may occasionally be found within a single segment. These \u0026ldquo;single-segment, multi-entry\u0026rdquo; (一段多項目, ichidan takōmoku) cases account for less than 1% of the total.\nBearing these principles and exceptions in mind, we will now explain the ID system for the Myōgishō. The complexity of the Myōgishō\u0026rsquo;s ID system stems largely from this occasional practice of recording two Entries within a single segment, a point to which users of this data should pay particular attention.\nID System of the Myōgishō # Types of IDs # In the Myōgishō data, Entries and individual character positions within Headwords are primarily managed by the following columns:\nEntry ID (entry_id - e.g., F00001) - F-format Headword Character ID (hanzi_id - e.g., S00001) - S-format Kazama Edition Location (kazama_location - e.g., K0100131) - K-format Tenri Edition Location (tenri_location - e.g., Ta023310) - T-format Relationship Between Columns # The Entry ID (entry_id) identifies one or more Headword Character IDs (hanzi_id) that constitute the Headword of that Entry.\nThe Headword Character ID (hanzi_id) is the primary key that uniquely identifies each individual character position within the data structure (particularly in files like krm_headword_chars).\nEach Headword Character ID (hanzi_id) is linked to corresponding location IDs (for the Kazama and Tenri editions).\nThe establishment of these four types of IDs accommodates the diversity of Entries in the Myōgishō and facilitates the use of multiple facsimile editions. For this reason, explanations of the F-format, S-format, K-format, and T-format IDs are provided repeatedly as needed, even if it involves some redundancy.\nDetailed Format of Primary IDs # Entry ID (entry_id / F-format) # Format: The Entry ID (entry_id) is a 5-digit number prefixed with \u0026lsquo;F\u0026rsquo;, forming a sequential series from F00001 to F32604. For some additionally inserted Entries, a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix is appended to the numeric part of the ID. It should be noted that while a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix may also be appended to the Headword Character ID (hanzi_id described below), the \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix for an entry_id is assigned independently of any \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix on a hanzi_id.\nPurpose: To uniquely identify each Entry in the Myōgishō.\nHeadword Character ID (hanzi_id / S-format) # Format: The Headword Character ID (hanzi_id) is a 5-digit number prefixed with \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo;, forming a sequential series from S00001 to S42328. This is the S-format. For some additionally inserted Headword characters, a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix is appended to the numeric part of the ID. It should be noted that while a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix may also be appended to the Entry ID (entry_id mentioned above), the \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix for a hanzi_id is assigned independently of any \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix on an entry_id.\nPurpose: To serve as the primary key that uniquely identifies each individual Headword character (i.e., each character position) within the dataset.\nSupplement: A separate data file lists all Headword Character IDs (hanzi_id), including those for the second and subsequent characters in multi-character Headwords. This file is krm_headword_chars, the details of which are described elsewhere.\nKazama Edition Location (kazama_location / K-format) # Format: K + Volume (2 digits) + Kazama Edition Page number (3 digits) + Line number (1 digit) + Segment number (1 digit) + Character Order (1 digit). This is the K-format.\nCharacter Order (1 digit): This digit is a number assigned based on the type of Entry (single-character or multi-character) and its order of appearance within that segment. While the \u0026ldquo;Character Order\u0026rdquo; is fundamentally a criterion based on individual character positions, it is used here to indicate the location of an Entry by referencing the position of the first character of that Entry within the segment.\nThe use of a character-position-based criterion for this \u0026ldquo;Character Order\u0026rdquo; digit is specifically to address the exceptional cases where two or more Entries are recorded within a single segment (which can also be thought of as a single cell or block in the layout).\nTo apply this character-position-based criterion representatively for the \u0026ldquo;Character Order,\u0026rdquo; the following rules for determining this digit have been established:\nCase 1: If there is only one Entry in the segment If the Entry is a single-character Entry, the Character Order is 0. If the Entry is a multi-character Entry, the Character Order is 1. Case 2: If there are two or more Entries in the segment For the first Entry in the segment, the Character Order is 1. For the second or subsequent Entries in the segment, the Character Order indicates the position of the first character of that Entry, counted sequentially from the beginning of the segment (where the first character position in the segment is counted as 1). For example, consider a segment containing \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; and then \u0026lsquo;BC\u0026rsquo;, where \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; is the 1st character in the segment, \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo; is the 2nd, and \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo; is the 3rd. The Entry \u0026lsquo;BC\u0026rsquo; is the second Entry in this segment. Its first character is \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo;, which is the 2nd character from the beginning of the segment. Therefore, the Character Order for the Entry \u0026lsquo;BC\u0026rsquo; is 2. Alternatively, consider a segment containing \u0026lsquo;AB\u0026rsquo; and then \u0026lsquo;CD\u0026rsquo;, where \u0026lsquo;A\u0026rsquo; is the 1st character, \u0026lsquo;B\u0026rsquo; the 2nd, \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo; the 3rd, and \u0026lsquo;D\u0026rsquo; the 4th. The Entry \u0026lsquo;CD\u0026rsquo; is the second Entry in this segment. Its first character is \u0026lsquo;C\u0026rsquo;, which is the 3rd character from the beginning of the segment. Therefore, the Character Order for the Entry \u0026lsquo;CD\u0026rsquo; is 3.\nExamples of kazama_location IDs:\nK01001310: (Indicates a single-character Entry, one Entry per segment) Volume 1, Page 1, Line 3, Segment 1, Character Order 0.

Purpose: To indicate the location of an Entry in the Kazama Edition. This ID system is determined based on rules for indicating character position, designed to accommodate all various arrangement patterns of Entries: the primarily used \u0026ldquo;single-segment, single-entry\u0026rdquo; arrangement; the frequently occurring \u0026ldquo;multi-segment, single-entry\u0026rdquo; arrangement; and the rare \u0026ldquo;single-segment, multi-entry\u0026rdquo; arrangement.\nSource: Based on Ruiju Myōgishō, Daiikkan (類聚名義抄　第一巻, Ruiju Myōgishō, Vol. 1), edited by Masamune Atsuo (Tokyo: Kazama Shobō, 1954).\nTenri Edition Location (tenri_location / T-format) # The Tenri Edition Location (tenri_location) follows principles similar to those for determining the K-format of the Kazama Edition Location. Its format, Character Order, and purpose are defined as follows:\nFormat: T + Volume (a/b/c) + Page number (3 digits) + Line number (1 digit) + Segment number (1 digit) + Character Order (1 digit). This is the T-format.\nCharacter Order (1 digit): This digit is a number assigned based on the type of Entry (single-character or multi-character) and its order of appearance within that segment.

For the second or subsequent Entries in the segment, the Character Order indicates the position of the first character of that Entry, counted sequentially from the beginning of the segment (where the first character position in the segment is counted as 1). The method for indicating the Tenri Edition Location is based on the same principles as that for the Kazama Edition Location. The examples used to explain the Kazama Edition Location, if shown as Tenri Edition Locations, would be as follows (using hypothetical Tenri IDs for illustration, actual examples below):\nExamples of tenri_location IDs:\nTa023310: (Indicates a single-character Entry, one Entry per segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 23, Line 3, Segment 1, Character Order 0.

As the Single Character Form generally does not pose particular input issues, this section will focus on the input method for Headwords in Multi-Character Form.\nFor Multi-Character Form Headwords, whether they represent a co-listing of variant characters (itaiji) or an idiom/compound, the constituent characters of the Headword are input separated by a \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo; (full-width slash, U+FF0F).\nIf a Headword in an Entry contains \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo;, this indicates that the Headword is in Multi-Character Form. The number of characters in such a Headword can be determined by the number of segments separated by the \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo; (e.g., one slash results in two segments, indicating two characters).\nExamples:\nCo-listing of variant characters (itaiji): 翛／倐／倏／翛β Idiom/compound: 一／人 For details on how to input characters using Unicode, please refer to the Character Encoding and Representation section.\nHandling of IDs in Data Representation # The main entry data for the Myōgishō (e.g., in krm_main.tsv) is published in TSV format. This subsection explains how each ID is represented in the TSV files, with a particular focus on the representation rules for Multi-Character Form Entries. While some explanations may overlap with those in other sections (such as \u0026ldquo;Detailed Format of Primary IDs,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Input Method for Headwords,\u0026rdquo; and the section on krm_headword_chars which details individual headword characters and acts as a mapping table), this information is crucial for processing the TSV-formatted data and is therefore summarized again here.\nTSV Columns and Corresponding IDs:\nThe primary TSV files store the following IDs in their respective columns:\nentry_id: Entry ID (F-format) hanzi_id: Headword Character ID (S-format) kazama_location: Kazama Edition Location (K-format) tenri_location: Tenri Edition Location (T-format) IDs other than those listed above (e.g., the Headword Character IDs or location IDs for the second and subsequent characters within a multi-character Headword) are not directly stored in this primary file but can be referenced through a separate mapping table (krm_headword_chars.tsv).\nData Representation Rules for Multi-Character Form Entries\nMulti-Character Form Headwords (such as those co-listing variant characters (itaiji) or representing idioms/compounds) are stored as a string in the hanzi_entry column, with constituent characters separated by a full-width slash (\u0026rsquo;／\u0026rsquo;). Regarding the representation of IDs, the main TSV row corresponding to a Multi-Character Form Entry displays only the IDs related to the first character of that Headword. IDs (S-format, K-format, T-format) related to the second and subsequent characters that constitute the Headword are omitted from this main row. Example: Suppose there is an Entry with the Headword \u0026ldquo;AB\u0026rdquo; (composed of A + B), and their respective IDs are as follows:\nEntry ID: F25121 Headword Character ID for A: S31590 (Kazama Edition Location: K08084411, Tenri Edition Location: Tc090411) Headword Character ID for B: S31591 (Kazama Edition Location: K08084412, Tenri Edition Location: Tc090412) When this Entry is represented in the TSV file, the main row would appear as follows (showing relevant columns only):\nentry_id hanzi_id hanzi_entry kazama_location tenri_location F25121 S31590 AB K08084411 Tc090411 It can be seen that this row contains only the Entry ID, the Headword Character ID for the first character, the complete Headword string, and the location IDs for the first character.\nDeferring Detailed Headword Character Information to a Mapping Table # All of the following detailed information pertaining to Headword characters is deferred to the mapping table krm_headword_chars:\nThe complete list of more detailed location information (K-format, T-format) corresponding to each Headword Character ID (S-format). The cropped image file name corresponding to each individual Headword character (S-format).

It is one of the Hanzi dictionary databases comprising the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (abbreviated as HDIC). The terms \u0026lsquo;kanji\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;hanzi\u0026rsquo; are explained later.\nThe Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō is a Hanzi (Chinese character) dictionary compiled in the twelfth century by a Shingon Buddhist monk. It has long been regarded as an important resource for research in Japanese historical linguistics due to its extensive collection of:\nJapanese Native Readings (wakun) that indicate accent (often with Tone marks), detailed Phonetic Glosses on the pronunciation of Hanzi (Chinese characters), and comprehensive Notes on Character Form, including information on variant characters (itaiji). Furthermore, its annotations written in literary Chinese—which include fanqie spellings, Semantic Glosses in Chinese (explaining meanings), and Notes on Character Form (detailing glyph forms)—have also garnered attention as valuable materials for the study of Chinese linguistics.\nIt was first published in March 2022, and in March 2025, a revised edition with specification changes and detailed explanations will be released.\nKanji and Hanzi # To bridge the gap between \u0026lsquo;Kanji\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Hanzi,\u0026rsquo; and to facilitate international academic discourse, the following supplementary explanation may be useful:\nDictionaries of Chinese characters compiled in Japan during the Heian period are invaluable resources not only for the study of Japanese linguistics but also for the study of Chinese linguistics. To promote international accessibility, we propose using the term \u0026lsquo;Hanzi.\u0026rsquo; Researchers specializing in Japanese studies may, without any issue, read this term as \u0026lsquo;Kanji.\u0026rsquo; This approach aims to respect the linguistic diversity and academic traditions of both fields, while encouraging broader scholarly exchange.\nThis explanation aims to provide clarity and respect for both terminologies, ensuring that researchers from different backgrounds can engage with the material without linguistic barriers.\nFor these reasons, \u0026lsquo;hanzi\u0026rsquo; is used for the column names of the public data, while \u0026lsquo;kanji\u0026rsquo; is used in the explanatory text.\nList of Data Files # The data for the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō, available at https://github.com/shikeda/krm, is as follows.

Then, rearrange it according to the order of locations in the Kanchi-in manuscript, collate it with the text of the Kanchi-in manuscript, and add the page numbers and character order of the Kanchi-in manuscript that are not found in the \u0026ldquo;Kanji Index.\u0026rdquo;\nStep 3: Take in various information included in the Tenrei Banshō Meigi database (Dai Kanwa Jiten index numbers, Unicode numbers, kanji characters, location information in the Tenrei Banshō Meigi) and the corresponding location information of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript created in Step 2, into the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database (created in Step 1) to create an input database for the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text.\nStep 4: While referring to the facsimile edition of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript (Tenri Library Rare Books Series, Japanese Books Section, Volumes 32-34) and the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database, add the text information for the listed characters and their explanations (\u0026ldquo;chūmon/chūbun\u0026rdquo;) to the input database for the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text created in Step 3.\nStep 5: Integrate the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript image database and the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript text database to form the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript database. Then, check and revise the text content using the newly published color facsimile edition of the Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript (New Tenri Library Rare Books Series, Volumes 9-11). When checking the text content, also distinguish between compound word entries and variant character entries in the listed items, and distinguish between font annotations, pronunciation annotations, meaning annotations, and Japanese glosses in the explanations, and add this information.\nStep 6: Publish the completed Ruiju Myōgishō Kanchi-in manuscript database on the internet and provide a search service.\nOnline Information Provision # HDIC\u0026rsquo;s online information provision consists of three parts: the main site, the search screen, and the text data.

It also describes the multiple methods used in combination to handle characters that cannot be represented by Unicode.\nCharacter Encoding with Unicode # The number of CJK Unified Ideographs differs depending on the Unicode version. The HDIC project started in 2014, and initially, the baseline was Unicode 8.0.0 (from 2015). At that time, the number of usable Hanzi (Chinese characters) was 80,358, comprising CJK Unified Ideographs and CJK Unified Ideographs Extensions A through E. Extensions have continued since then, with the total number of characters now exceeding 90,000. However, even after characters are included in Unicode, it seems to take time before they can actually be displayed on screens or used in print. The HDIC project utilizes characters up to CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E as much as possible. For characters in Extension F and beyond, the project currently limits its practice to noting them in remarks columns or similar fields.\nRepresentation of Characters Outside of Unicode # \u0026ldquo;Characters outside of Unicode\u0026rdquo; refers to Hanzi (Chinese characters) that are not included in the Unicode standard. These characters are represented using the following three methods:\nIDS Method Entity Reference Method Beta Method (β Method) The IDS Method is used when a character can be represented by a combination of its constituent components, described using an IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence). The IDS data used and referenced in this project is primarily that constructed and made publicly available by Morioka Tomohiko in the CHISE IDS Search.\nAn IDS is indicated by IDCs (Ideographic Description Characters). The twelve IDCs are: ⿰, ⿱, ⿲, ⿳, ⿴, ⿵, ⿶, ⿷, ⿸, ⿹, ⿺, and ⿻.\nExamples:\nExample of the IDS Method: ⿰亻胃 (representing a character with the \u0026lsquo;亻\u0026rsquo; radical on the left and \u0026lsquo;胃\u0026rsquo; on the right), ⿰亻⿱𡈼儿 (a variant of \u0026lsquo;凭\u0026rsquo;, an example using multiple IDCs). If representation by the IDS Method is difficult, one of the following methods is used.\nThe Entity Reference Method involves describing characters using notations based on the entity reference systems of CHISE and GlyphWiki.\nExamples:\nCHISE Entity Reference Method: ⿺辶\u0026amp;CDP-8C66; (a variant of \u0026lsquo;延\u0026rsquo;, where \u0026amp;CDP-8C66; represents the bottom-right component of \u0026lsquo;𠂢\u0026rsquo;, a glyph similar to 𧘇). GlyphWiki Entity Reference Method: koseki-007510 (representing a glyph with \u0026lsquo;ヽ\u0026rsquo; at the top-right of \u0026lsquo;𠇾\u0026rsquo;). The Beta Method (β Method) involves describing characters by combining a graphically similar character with Greek letters such as β (beta), γ (gamma), etc. This Beta Method was proposed by Toyoshima Masayuki.\nExample:\nExample of the Beta Method: 正β (representing a glyph with two horizontal \u0026lsquo;ヽ\u0026rsquo; strokes inside the \u0026lsquo;匸\u0026rsquo; radical of \u0026lsquo;正\u0026rsquo;). Characters that cannot be represented by any of the above methods, or characters that are illegible in the original manuscript (due to damage such as wormholes, etc.), are represented by \u0026lsquo;■\u0026rsquo; (a black square). For more details on illegible characters, please refer to the section \u0026ldquo;Wormholes and Illegible Characters.\u0026rdquo;\nUtilizing GlyphWiki # To display glyphs in a Mincho typeface that closely approximate those in the manuscript, GlyphWiki (developed by Uechi Kōichi) can be utilized. By using GlyphWiki, it is possible to display such approximate Mincho-style glyphs.\nThe creation of glyph forms for the Headwords of the Myōgishō using GlyphWiki is currently in progress and not yet complete, but it is mentioned here for reference.\nBy associating GlyphWiki glyph numbers with the kazama_location_id found in the krm_headword_chars file, the Headwords of the Ruiju Myōgishō can be represented in a Mincho typeface.\nThe GlyphWiki glyph number is expressed by taking a prefix—formed by combining the abbreviation for this project (HDIC) with the abbreviation for the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō (KRM), resulting in hdic_hkrm-—and appending the numerical part of the kazama_location_id (from krm_headword_chars) after removing its \u0026lsquo;K\u0026rsquo; prefix.\nFor example, for a Headword within an Entry (e.g., with an entry_id like F01234), if its corresponding kazama_location_id in the krm_headword_chars file is K01075140, then its GlyphWiki glyph number will be hdic_hkrm-01075140.\nThis will be demonstrated next using Markdown notation.\nExample:\n![正β](https://glyphwiki.org/glyph/hdic_hkrm-01075140.png) When described in Markdown as shown above, it will be displayed as follows:\nThis character size is large; if you wish to use a smaller size, use the following notation:\n![正β](https://glyphwiki.org/glyph/hdic_hkrm-01075140.50px.png) When described in Markdown as shown above, it will be displayed as follows:\nNote that the filename hdic_hkrm-01075140.png is derived from the numerical part of the kazama_location_id K01075140 found in the krm_headword_chars file.\nTo display it with a specified size, you can write it as follows:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026ldquo;https://glyphwiki.org/glyph/hdic_hkrm-01075140.png\" title=\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; class=\u0026ldquo;center\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;24\u0026rdquo; height=\u0026ldquo;24\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/en/docs/krm/03-entry-data-model/","title":"Entry Data Model","section":"Ruiju Myogisho","content":" Entry Data Model # Regarding the Kanchi-in manuscript Ruiju Myōgishō:\nFirst, under Entry Data Structure, we present the internal components of an Entry (such as Headword, Phonetic Gloss, and Japanese Native Reading(wakun)) using specific examples (visual representations and transcriptions), and provide an abstracted and visualized diagram of the Entry structure.\nNext, under Types of Entries, different kinds, such as basic Entries and supplementary Entries, are discussed.\nFurthermore, under Concepts Related to Character Notation, script styles (書体, shotai), the standard of writing Chinese characters (字体, jitai), and the shapes of Chinese characters (字形, jikei), along with variant characters (異体字, itaiji) and graphically similar characters, are explained.\nFinally, we cover the Entry Data Files, including their content, specific examples, and the methods used for publication and updates via GitHub.\nEntry Data Structure Types of Entries Concepts Related to Character Notation Publication and Updates of Entry Data Files "},{"id":6,"href":"/en/docs/krm/01-introduction/01-01-introduction/","title":"Overview of the Ruiju Myōgishō","section":"Overview","content":" Overview of the Ruiju Myōgishō # Ikeda Shōju\nDate published: April 20, 2025\nThis section provides an overview of the Ruiju Myōgishō, detailing its extant manuscripts, presumed compiler and provenance, scholarly significance, structural organization, textual sources, available facsimiles and indices, as well as pertinent secondary literature.\nManuscript Traditions Compiler Date of Compilation Significance Radical Structure Number of Entries Sources Facsimile Original Compilation Revised Compilation Indexes References Manuscript Traditions # The extant manuscripts of the Ruiju Myōgishō fall into two distinct textual lineages: the original compilation and its later redactions.\nThe sole surviving exemplar of the original compilation is held by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency, and this lineage is often referred to as the gensenbon (original compilation) tradition. The manuscript in question was introduced in 1950 as the Zushoryō manuscript (Library of Ancient Books manuscript).\nThe redacted lineage, alternatively termed the kaihenbon-kei (redacted version lineage) or Kōekibon tradition, includes several known manuscripts: the Kanchi-in manuscript, the Kōzan-ji manuscript, the Renshō-in manuscript, the Sainen-ji manuscript, and the Hōbodai-in manuscript. Of these, only the Kanchi-in manuscript survives in complete form; the remaining examples are fragmentary or incomplete. The redacted tradition has been the subject of sustained scholarly inquiry since the Edo period, beginning with the work of Ban Nobutomo and others.\nIn Japanese scholarship, it is common practice to refer to individual manuscripts by appending bon (meaning “copy” or “text”) to the name of the holding temple or institution—for example, Kanchi-in bon. In this paper, however, these will be referred to using the English term “manuscript” for clarity and consistency.\nIn contemporary scholarship, the work is frequently referred to in abbreviated form as the Myōgishō.\nCompiler # The compiler of the original compilation is presumed to have been a Buddhist scholar-monk affiliated with the Hossō school, or possibly trained in both the Hossō and Shingon traditions, though their identity remains unknown. The compiler of the redacted version is likewise unidentified but is generally believed to have been a Shingon scholar-monk. A long-standing theory attributing the work to Sugawara no Koreyoshi is now considered erroneous.\nDate of Compilation # The sole extant exemplar of the original compilation—the Zushoryō manuscript—is a fragment of a single fascicle categorized under the Dharma section (hōbu), referring to one of the traditional Buddhist categories corresponding to the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha).\nAlthough it bears no colophon or scribal note, it is generally dated to the Insei (cloistered rule) period. The text makes reference to the monk Eichō Sōzu (Eichō, Bishop), who is known to have received the title Sōzu in 1081 (Eihō 1). Based on this and other circumstantial evidence, the work is believed to have been compiled by around the year 1000.\nAs for the redacted version, a manuscript from Kōzan-ji contains a marginal note in the hand of the Kōyasan monk Genshō, dated to 1178 (Jishō 2). Since this note corresponds to content found in the redacted Ruiju Myōgishō, it is inferred that the revised compilation had been completed by that time.\nSignificance # The Ruiju Myōgishō lists Chinese characters, presented either as individual graphs or as compounds. These entries are typically accompanied by various forms of explanatory notes, including:\nfanqie spellings (反切) to indicate pronunciation, homophone glosses (類音注), Sino-Japanese readings (字音) transcribed in katakana (片仮名), Semantic Glosses in Chinese (漢文による意義注) explaining character meanings in literary Chinese, Japanese Native Readings (wakun, 和訓) transcribed in katakana, and Notes on Character Form (字体注) that specify orthographic variants such as \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; (正) and \u0026ldquo;popular/variant\u0026rdquo; (俗) forms. Furthermore, tone marks (shōten, 声点) are sometimes added to both the Sino-Japanese and native readings. Consequently, the Myōgishō is an invaluable resource for research in the history of the Japanese lexicon, the historical phonology of Sino-Japanese character readings, and the history of Chinese character forms as used in Japan.\nThe work lists Chinese characters both as individual graphs and compounds, accompanied by fanqie spellings, homophone glosses, katakana transcriptions for Sino-Japanese readings, literary Chinese definitions, native Japanese readings (wakun) in katakana, and annotations indicating orthographic variants such as “standard” and “popular” forms. Phonetic marks (shōten) are sometimes added to both the Sino-Japanese and native readings.\nRadical Structure # According to the Kanchi-in manuscript, the Ruiju Myōgishō is organized into 120 sections grouped under the three divisions of the Buddhist Triratna: Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧). Each division is further subdivided into several volumes or fascicles (巻 kan), such as \u0026ldquo;Upper,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Middle,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Lower. Each division contains 40 sections based on semantic radicals. The table below presents the full list of radicals used, shown with their associated head characters (部首字).\nBuddha Division (仏)\n(Upper Volume)\n1 人 2 彳 3 辵 4 匚 5 走 6 麦 7 一 8 丨 9 十 10 身\n(Middle Volume)\n11 耳 12 女 13 舌 14 口 15 目 16 鼻 17 見 18 日 19 田 20 肉\n(Lower Volume, Part 1)\n21 舟 22 骨 23 角 24 貝 25 頁 26 彡 27 髟 28 手 29 木 30 犬\n(Lower Volume, Part 2)\n31 牛 32 片 33 豸 34 乙 35 儿 36 𠬞 37 八 38 大 39 火 40 黒\nDharma Division (法)\n(Upper Volume)\n41 水 42 冫 43 言 44 足 45 立 46 豆 47 卜 48 面 49 歯 50 山\n(Middle Volume)\n51 石 52 玉 53 色 54 邑 55 阜 56 土 57 心 58 巾 59 糸 60 衣\n(Lower Volume)\n61 示 62 禾 63 米 64 丶 65 宀 66 勹 67 穴 68 雨 69 門 70 口 71 尸 72 虍 73 广 74 鹿 75 疒 76 歹 77 子 78 斗 79 倝 80 寸\nSangha Division (僧)\n(Upper Volume)\n81 艸 82 竹 83 力 84 刀 85 羽 86 毛 87 食 88 金\n(Middle Volume)\n89 亼 90 爪 91 网 92 皿 93 瓦 94 缶 95 弓 96 㫃 97 矢 98 斤 99 矛 100 戈 101 欠 102 又 103 攴 104 殳 105 皮 106 革 107 韋 108 車 109 羊 110 馬 111 鳥 112 隹\n(Lower Volume)\n113 魚 114 虫 115 鼠 116 亀 117 鬼 118 風 119 酉 120 雑\nNote on Organization:\nThe radical system employed in the Ruiju Myōgishō follows the structure of the Yùpiān (『玉篇』) compiled by Liang dynasty scholar Gu Yewang, which comprises 542 sections. Radicals of similar form were grouped together (e.g., integrating 彳 and 行 under a single radical), while those with fewer entries were consolidated into the final miscellaneous section (雑).\nAdditionally, the ordering of radicals reflects both semantic grouping (e.g., parts of the body, food, clothing, animals, plants, etc.) and visual similarity of character shapes. For example, the 女 radical follows 耳, and 言 follows 冫, likely because the cursive or semi-cursive forms of 耳 and 言 resemble 女 and 冫, respectively.\nNumber of Entries # The term entry refers to a unit consisting of both the headword and its accompanying definitions (original glosses). To provide a general sense of the scope of the Ruiju Myōgishō, we may look to the Kanchi-in manuscript for a representative overview. The following table presents a summary of the number of entries, the number of individual headwords, and the number of compound expressions found in each of the ten volumes, from the Buddha (Upper) through the Sangha (Lower) sections.\nTable: Number of Entries, Characters, and Compound Expressions by Volume (Kanchi-in Manuscript)\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of character entries across the ten volumes of the Ruiju Myōgishō as preserved in the Kanchi-in manuscript. The work is structured into three main sections—Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧)—each comprising multiple volumes. The entries are classified by the number of characters per expression (from single-character to seven or more), along with totals for entries, characters, and compound expressions.\nVolume 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6-char 7+ char Total Entries Total Characters Compound Expressions Buddha (Upper) 1,650 469 53 13 3 2 2 2,192 2,840 329 Buddha (Middle) 3,123 573 55 20 9 1 5 3,786 4,620 325 Buddha (Lower 1) 3,027 679 100 13 5 2 2 3,828 4,790 417 Buddha (Lower 2) 1,287 264 28 9 1 1 2 1,592 1,963 140 Dharma (Upper) 3,054 437 61 8 4 3 5 3,572 4,226 213 Dharma (Middle) 3,623 622 61 15 7 3 4 4,335 5,195 310 Dharma (Lower) 2,721 760 134 10 5 2 7 3,639 4,774 416 Sangha (Upper) 2,226 1,100 185 24 6 4 1 3,546 5,139 635 Sangha (Middle) 1,974 939 133 23 4 3 2 3,078 4,397 386 Sangha (Lower) 1,996 829 167 30 6 4 7 3,039 4,396 409 Total 24,681 6,672 977 165 50 25 37 32,607 42,340 3,580 Sources # Original Compilation\nThe Zushoryō manuscript of the original compilation, though fragmentary and classified under the Hōbu-jō (Department of Dharma: Upper) section, is distinguished by its faithful citation of a wide range of texts, including bibliographic and authorial attributions. It is widely utilized as a vital source in the study of the history of the Japanese language.\nThe manuscript contains 3,657 entries in total, of which 951 are single-character headwords; the remainder are compound expressions. The majority of these compounds are derived from Buddhist glossaries such as Xuanying’s Yiqiejing yinyi, Shingō’s Daihannyakyō Onkun, Chūzan’s Myōhōrengekyō Shakumon, and works attributed to Cien.\nBeyond Buddhist phonetic commentaries, many entries are drawn from classical lexica such as Gu Yewang’s Yupian, Kūkai’s Tenrei Banshō Meigi, Sugawara no Koreyoshi’s Tōkyū Setsuin, and Minamoto no Shitagō’s Wamyō Ruijushō.\nThe citations from these sources follow a fixed order of precedence: in semantic glosses in literary Chinese, sacred Buddhist texts (naiten) are prioritized over secular Chinese or native Japanese texts (geten). The Japanese native readings (wakun) are based on annotated editions (kuntenbon) of secular literature. Tone marks (shōten) are applied with precision, offering valuable information about vocabulary and pitch accent in the Heian period. These tone marks also appear in the phonetic glosses of Chinese characters—such as fanqie, homophonic glosses, and katakana transcriptions—making the manuscript an important resource for the study of Sino-Japanese phonology.\nRevised Compilation\nThe Kanchi-in manuscript of the revised compilation—also known as the Kaihenbon or Kōekibon—contains approximately 32,000 headword entries and about 34,000 Japanese native readings (wakun). Of these, roughly 10,000 wakun are annotated with tone marks (shōten). The names of authors and titles of cited sources found in the original compilation have been removed, and many of the semantic glosses in literary Chinese have likewise been omitted. Japanese native readings (wakun) originally recorded in man’yōgana have been replaced with katakana.\nThere is a substantial expansion of single-character entries. For items carried over from the original compilation, Japanese native readings have been added and reorganized; for new entries introduced in the revised version, a large number of Japanese native readings have been supplemented as well, resulting in a significantly enlarged corpus of Japanese native readings.\nNotes on Character Form (字体注), which provide details on Variant Characters (itaiji) and distinctions such as \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; (正, sei) and \u0026ldquo;popular/variant\u0026rdquo; (俗, zoku) forms, along with Phonetic Glosses (字音注) indicating Go-on (呉音; also known as Wa-on, reflecting 5th-6th century pronunciations from Southern China, possibly transmitted via the Korean Peninsula) and Kan-on (漢音; also known as Sei-on, reflecting 7th-9th century pronunciations from Northern China, notably the Chang\u0026rsquo;an dialect) for the characters, together constitute a rich repository of materials for the study of Japanese linguistic history.\nWithin each radical category, headword entries are often arranged either by visual similarity or according to the character ordering found in the Yupian—referred to here as the Gyokuhen jijun-gun (“Yupian character order groups”).\nAlthough only the Hōbu-jō (Upper Dharma) section of the original compilation survives, comparison between the original and revised versions reveals the nature of additions and editorial changes. For sections no longer extant in the original compilation, it is possible to identify underlying textual sources by cross-referencing with the principal reference works that were extensively cited in the original. Of particular importance are frequently referenced texts such as Yiqiejing yinyi, Tenrei Banshō Meigi, and Wamyō Ruijushō, all of which remain extant in complete form. These sources should be consistently consulted when interpreting the revised compilation.\nFacsimile # Original Compilation # Zushoryō Manuscript\nFormerly held in the collection of the Shimizudani Kimiyasu family and currently preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency (Kunai-chō Shoryōbu), this manuscript was first published in 1950 as a facsimile edition titled Zushoryōbon Ruiju Myōgishō, retaining its original Japanese-style binding. The edition includes an introductory essay by Hashimoto Fumio and is available for viewing via the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nA Western-style bound edition was reissued in 1969, followed by a revised edition in 1976 featuring a complete set of indices—for sources, kana glosses, and Chinese characters—accompanied by commentary by Tsukishima Hiroshi, a kana index by Miyazawa Toshimasa, and a kanji index by Sakai Kenji.\nThe extant portion of the manuscript corresponds to the Hōbu jōge (“Upper” and “Lower” Dharma sections), specifically the upper volume (jōsatsu), which covers 20 radicals out of a total of 40 in this section. It is generally believed that the full compilation originally consisted of two volumes each for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha sections. The character “五” (“5”) inscribed in the upper right corner of the cover suggests that this volume was originally the fifth in the full six-volume set.\nOn March 26, 2025, a color version of the manuscript was made publicly available via the Shoryōbu Catalog and Image Database of the Archives and Mausolea Department.\nRevised Compilation # Kanchi-in Manuscript\nOriginally housed at Tō-ji’s Kanchi-in, this complete manuscript—consisting of one volume of section headings and ten volumes of main text—is now preserved at the Tenri Central Library. According to colophons, it was copied by Jinen in 1241 (Ninji 2) and later recopied by Kenkei in 1251 (Kenchō 3).\nSeveral facsimile and reproduction editions exist. The commonly cited versions are listed below, followed by brief descriptions:\nKichōtosho Edition (1937): A collotype facsimile edition in its original format, published by the Kichōtosho Fukuseikai, with commentary by Yamada Yoshio. Available via the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nKoten Zenshū Edition (1938–1940): Reproduced using letterpress printing by the Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, including kana and kanji indexes edited by Masamune Atsuo.\nKazama Edition (1954–1955): Republished by Kazama Shobō with commentary by Nakada Norio. Volume 1 contains the main text; Volume 2 contains kanji and kana indexes. Letterpress reproduction. This is a convenient reference edition as the index locations correspond to its pagination.\nOld Tenri Edition (1976): Reproduced with corrected foliation in Vols. 32–34 of the Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho: Washo no Bu, with commentary by Yoshida Kanehiko. Published by Tenri University Press and distributed by Yagi Shoten. Locations are cited using the original volume and folio numbers. Printed in monochrome using offset printing.\nNew Tenri Edition (2018): Published in Vols. 9–11 of the Shin Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho, based on high-resolution color photography taken after restoration, with commentary by Ōtsuki Makoto. Published by Tenri University Press and distributed by Yagi Shoten.\nThis edition includes references not only to the original volume and folio numbers, but also to the Old Tenri and Kazama Edition page numbers, enhancing its compatibility with the Kazama indexes.\nRenjō-in Manuscript\nPreviously held at Kōfuku-ji’s Renjō-in , this fragmentary manuscript (3 volumes) is now in the possession of Chinkoku Shukoku Shrine (Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture). Copied in the late Kamakura to early Muromachi period, it is also referred to as the Chinkoku Shukoku Shrine Manuscript.\nIt comprises: Volume 1 (corresponding to Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū in the Kanchi-in Manuscript); Volume 2 (covering up to mid-Hō-jō); and Volume 3 (corresponding to Sō). A facsimile edition was issued in 1965 by the Mikkan Kokubun Shiryō Kankōkai under the title Sanpō Ruiju Myōgishō, with commentary by Ozaki Satoakira. A clearer reproduction was issued in 1986 by Benseisha.\nKōsan-ji Manuscript\nFormerly held at Kōsan-ji and now preserved at the Tenri Central Library via the Hōrei Collection. This manuscript was copied during the Insei period (late Heian).\nIt consists of two fragmentary volumes corresponding to Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū of the Kanchi-in Manuscript. The first folio lists section headings under the title Sanbō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō, and the main text begins with Butsuhō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō I / Section 1: Jin. This corresponds to the entry in the Kōsan-ji Shōgyō Mokuroku (Kenchō Inventory), which records Sanpō Ruiji-shū as a six-volume work. In 2016, a high-resolution color facsimile was published as Vol. 8 of the Shin Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho, with commentary by Yamamoto Hideto.\nSainen-ji Manuscript\nA one-volume fragment transcribed in 1767 (Meiwa 4), based on the Eissatsu Manuscript, preserving portions of Butsu-jō and Butsu-chū. Now held by both the Tenri Central Library and Kansai University. Although no printed facsimile exists, images of the Kansai University copy are publicly available.\nA version preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency is also accessible and more closely resembles the Tenri copy than the Kansai University one. While the Tenri copy has often been used in prior scholarship, the lack of a published facsimile once required researchers to visit the library to obtain photographic reproductions. The Shoryōbu copy now allows readers to access the same textual content as the Tenri Sainen-ji Manuscript.\nHōbodai-in Manuscript\nA one-volume fragment covering the “Ship” (舟) through “Dog” (犬) sections of Butsu-ge in the Kanchi-in Manuscript, likely copied in the late Kamakura period.\nA facsimile edition was published in 2002 by Taishō University Press, with commentary by Kurashima Tokihisa. A wakun index compiled by the same scholar was published in 2006 by the same press.\nIndexes # Kanji Indexes\nMasamune Atsuo (ed.), Ruiju Myōgishō, Vol. 2: Kanji Index \u0026amp; Kana Index, Kazama Shobō, 1955.\nNagashima Toyotarō (ed.), Composite Index to Old Character Dictionaries (2 vols.), Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, 1958–1959.\nWakun (Japanese Reading) Indexes\nMasamune Atsuo (ed.), Ruiju Myōgishō: Kana Index, Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, 1939–1940.

Next, an example of an actual Entry is presented as an image (a facsimile). The structure of this Entry is then illustrated in an abstract and diagrammatic form. Finally, a transcription of the Entry shown in the image is provided.\n(Regarding the Japanese reading of \u0026ldquo;注文,\u0026rdquo; although we have adopted \u0026ldquo;chūmon,\u0026rdquo; it may also be read as \u0026ldquo;chūbun\u0026rdquo; to explicitly indicate that it refers to annotations on characters or words.)\nStructure of Entries # Explanation of Terms # The following explains the terms used to describe the constituent elements of Entries in the Myōgishō.\n(The English terminology presented in this section is defined from a philological viewpoint and may therefore occasionally vary from data column names or terms used in other sections of this documentation.)\nAn Entry consists of a Headword and Original Glosses.\nA Headword (掲出字) is also referred to as midashi, midashiji, hyōji, or hyōshutsushi. In Chinese, it is called zìtóu (字頭).\nOriginal Glosses consist of the following components: Phonetic Gloss (音注, onchū), Semantic Gloss in Chinese (漢文義注, kanbun gichū), Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*) (和訓, wakun), Notes on Character Form (字体注, jitaichū), and Other.\nA Phonetic Gloss is provided through methods such as fanqie spellings (反切), Similar sound notes (類音注, ruion-chū), Kana glosses (仮名音注, kana-onchū), Tone marks (*shōten*) (声点), and other notations.\nA Semantic Gloss in Chinese is also sometimes referred to as gichū (義注, semantic gloss) or kanbun imichū (漢文意味注, semantic gloss in Chinese). Unless it causes misunderstanding, it is often simply referred to as Semantic Gloss (義注).\nA Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*) refers to kun\u0026rsquo;yomi (native Japanese readings of Chinese characters) and is also sometimes called wakunchū (Japanese native reading glosses). It is generally written in Katakana. For example, \u0026lsquo;mono\u0026rsquo; may be written with the abbreviated character \u0026lsquo;牜\u0026rsquo; (a variant of 物), and \u0026lsquo;koto\u0026rsquo; may use the ligature \u0026lsquo;ヿ\u0026rsquo;. There is one instance where Man\u0026rsquo;yōgana is used (e.g., \u0026lsquo;度久佐\u0026rsquo; for \u0026lsquo;木賊\u0026rsquo;).\nNotes on Character Form are indicated using terms describing character-form norms, such as \u0026lsquo;正\u0026rsquo; (standard) or \u0026lsquo;俗\u0026rsquo; (popular).\nThere are instances of Semantic Glosses in Chinese, Katakana text, etc., written around the Headword; these can be termed Supplementary Headword Annotations (掲出字補注, Keishutsuji Hochū). These have been classified into Phonetic Glosses, Japanese Native Readings (*wakun*), etc., according to their content. In the process of data conversion, measures were taken to clearly identify them as Supplementary Headword Annotations (see \u0026ldquo;Supplementary Headword Annotations\u0026rdquo; under \u0026ldquo;Handling Issues in Transcription, Notation, and Annotation\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Input of Entry Data\u0026rdquo; section).\nOther includes items marked as unknown (未詳, mishō), notes on textual transmission (伝写上の注記, densha-jō no chūki), and cases where the type of gloss could not be determined.\nExamples of Entries (Images) # The following presents facsimile reproductions of Entries from the Myōgishō as specific examples, including those for \u0026lsquo;功\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;加復\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;ー之\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;助\u0026rsquo; (along with its variant characters (itaiji)).\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026quot;/images/krm-item-sample1.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026ldquo;entry structure\u0026rdquo; width=\u0026ldquo;500px\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}\nDiagram of Entry Structure # The following is a diagram illustrating the structure of an Entry that contains all elements of a Headword and its Original Glosses.\ngraph TB A(Entry) A---\u003eB(Headword) A---\u003eC(Original Glosses) C---\u003eD(Notes on Character Form) C---\u003eE(Phonetic Gloss) C---\u003eF(Semantic Gloss in Chinese) C---\u003eG(Japanese Native Reading) C---\u003eH(Other) Example of an Entry (Transcription) # Next, we present transcriptions of the examples shown in the images of sample Entries.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s consider \u0026ldquo;功,\u0026rdquo; an Entry that includes the basic elements.\nExample\n功　音工（L-R）「コウ（_N）」「クウ（_N）」　續也　事也　成也　タシカニ（LHLH）　𭃄歟 Headword: 功 Elements of the Original Glosses: Phonetic Gloss: 音工（L-R）「コウ（_N）」「クウ（_N）」 Semantic Gloss (in Chinese): 續也　事也　成也 Japanese Native Reading (wakun): タシカニ（LHLH） Note on Character Form: 𭃄歟 This structure should clearly illustrate the relationship between the Headword and the elements of the Original Glosses. However, a detailed explanation of this Entry\u0026rsquo;s content would require considerable text. The Japanese quotation marks (kagi-kakko) 「」 enclose supplementary notes, and the symbols shown in parentheses () are Romanized representations of Tone marks (*shōten*) and nasal sound symbols.

To accurately decipher its content and convert it into digital text, it is necessary to first understand the various characteristics visible in the original Myōgishō manuscripts and then to establish specific methods for data input and processing.\nFirst, as the Myōgishō is an ancient manuscript, scribal errors are unavoidable. Under Scribal Issues, we will address Miswritten Characters (誤字, goji), Omitted Characters (脱字, datsuji), Superfluous Characters (衍字, enji), and Correction Marks (訂正符号, teisei fugō).\nNext, the Myōgishō employs sophisticated notational conventions for characters and words to convey diverse information related to the form, sound, and meaning of Hanzi (Chinese characters) accurately and efficiently. Under Notational Conventions for Characters and Words, we will discuss frequently used Abbreviated Characters (略字, ryakuji), Variant Characters (itaiji) (異体字), Iteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji), and Substitution Marks (代用符号, daiyō fugō). Although not numerous, examples of Compound Marks (合符, gōfu)—symbols used to connect characters to indicate they form a compound word—also exist and will be briefly introduced here. Since the nature of Substitution Marks and Compound Marks can be difficult to grasp, they will be explained in detail with examples in their respective dedicated sections.\nFinally, various ingenious methods are also applied to information added beyond the main text of the Myōgishō, as well as to physical characteristics such as layout and variations in character size. Under Additional Notations and Layout Features, we will cover:\nInterlinear Notes (割注, warichū), variations in the size of characters within Original Glosses (注文文字の大小, chūmon moji no daishō), Small Character Annotations (小字注記, shōji chūki), Annotations from Variant Manuscripts (異本注記, ihon chūki), Source Attributions (出典注記, shutten chūki), Tone Marks (shōten) (声点), Morphosyntactic Glosses (wokototen) (ヲコト点), line breaks and spacing (改行・空白, kaigyō/kūhaku), Interpolated Glosses (補入注文, honyū chūmon), unannotated Entries (無注記, muchūki), and other noteworthy cases. We will also explain how these are input and processed. The explanation of Tone Marks (shōten) will concurrently cover voiced sound symbols and nasal sound symbols.\u0026quot;\nWhile the primary focus of this explanation will be on issues common to the entire text of the Myōgishō, if there are problems specific to the constituent elements of an Entry—namely the Headword, Notes on Character Form, Phonetic Glosses, Semantic Glosses in Chinese, and Japanese Native Readings (wakun)—these will also be addressed according to their significance. For example, \u0026ldquo;iteration marks\u0026rdquo; (踊り字, odoriji) are a common issue across various elements of an Entry, whereas \u0026ldquo;Tone Marks (shōten)\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;nasal sound symbols\u0026rdquo; (鼻音符号, bionfugō) are particularly problematic in the context of Phonetic Glosses.\nIn the published data, the transcription of Headwords is recorded in the hanzi_entry and original_entry columns of the krm_main file. Similarly, the hanzi_entry and original_entry columns in the krm_notes file contain the same content as those in krm_main. The krm_wakun file exclusively lists Japanese Native Reading (wakun) data in its wakun_elements column.\nFurthermore, instances requiring particularly detailed explanation are described in the remarks column of the krm_notes file as Compiler's Remarks.\nFor more details on the overall structure of the published data and file formats, please refer to the Overview of Public Data.\nThe transcription of the Original Glosses is recorded in the definition column of the krm_main public data file. In the krm_notes file, the constituent elements of the Original Glosses—namely Notes on Character Form, Phonetic Glosses, Semantic Glosses in Chinese, Japanese Native Readings (wakun), and Other information—are categorized and recorded in the definition_elements column.\nScribal Issues # This section addresses issues such as Miswritten Characters (誤字, goji), Omitted Characters (脱字, datsuji), Superfluous Characters (衍字, enji), and Correction Marks (訂正符号, teisei fugō).\nMiswritten Characters (誤字, goji) # When a Headword is clearly a Miswritten Character (誤字, goji), the collated (corrected) form is recorded in the hanzi_entry column, and the original manuscript form is recorded in the original_entry column. The basis for the collation is provided in the remarks column of the krm_notes file (for details on krm_notes, please refer to the relevant section in the Overview of Public Data).\nExamples (Original Japanese remarks):\nhanzi_entry: 向／後, original_entry: 〇／ー（彴）, remarks: 掲出字は「向後」とすべきを誤る。岡田研究193-194頁に「ー」使用は高山寺本が適切との指摘あり。 hanzi_entry: 姡, original_entry: 活, remarks: 掲出字は誤写。高山寺本・蓮成院本・西念寺本「姡」に作るにより改める。 As illustrated by the preceding examples, the remarks in the krm_notes file are originally written in Japanese.

If further explanation is necessary, it is provided separately (e.g., in the Compiler's Remarks).\nExamples:\n将／［指］ 叔／［母］ In Example 1, the Headword is found in the \u0026ldquo;手\u0026rdquo; (hand) radical section, and it is evident from the context that the character \u0026lsquo;指\u0026rsquo; is missing.\nIn Example 2, the Headword is found in the \u0026ldquo;女\u0026rdquo; (woman) radical section. Given the presence of the character \u0026lsquo;母\u0026rsquo; in preceding and succeeding Entries, its omission here is clear.\nIf it is clear that a character has been omitted, but the specific missing character is unknown, it is indicated by a full-width underscore within full-width square brackets, like \u0026ldquo;［＿］\u0026rdquo;.\nThe following example illustrates a case where either the first or second character of a fanqie spelling was clearly omitted, but the specific missing character is unknown.\nExample:\n𤎥 ［＿］覽反 In this example, the Original Glosses for \u0026lsquo;𤎥\u0026rsquo; show \u0026ldquo;覽反\u0026rdquo;. According to the Guangyun, \u0026lsquo;𤎥\u0026rsquo; has readings chùzhān qiè (處占切; level tone, 鹽韻, for the character 䪜) or tǔgǎn qiè (吐敢切; rising tone, 敢韻, for the character 𦵹). Since \u0026lsquo;覽\u0026rsquo; has the Guangyun reading gǎnlú qiè (敢盧切; rising tone, 敢韻), it is clear that the first character of the fanqie spelling is missing. Therefore, it is transcribed as \u0026ldquo;［＿］覽反\u0026rdquo;.\nSuperfluous Characters (衍字, enji) # Cases of Superfluous Characters (衍字, enji) are noted in the remarks column of the krm_notes.tsv file.\nExamples are shown below in the order of Headword (hanzi_entry), relevant part of the Original Glosses (definition_elements from krm_notes or context from krm_main\u0026rsquo;s definition), and Compiler's Remarks (remarks).\nExamples:\nHeadword (hanzi_entry): 胳 Original Glosses (excerpt from definition / definition_elements): 又俗音腋也 Compiler's Remarks (remarks): The character \u0026lsquo;也\u0026rsquo; in \u0026ldquo;又俗音腋也\u0026rdquo; is superfluous. Headword (hanzi_entry): 眺 Original Glosses (excerpt from definition / definition_elements): *ヒカヽメ Compiler's Remarks (remarks): The Shinsen Jikyō has \u0026ldquo;又比加目\u0026rdquo;. The \u0026lsquo;ヽ\u0026rsquo; mark here is possibly a superfluous character, but this remains questionable (存疑, zongi). Correction Marks (訂正符号, teisei fugō) # The marks used for corrections in the main text include Transposition Marks (転倒符, tentōfu), Deletion Marks (見消符, misekechifu), and Interpolation Marks (補入符, honyūfu).\nTransposition Marks (転倒符, tentōfu; also called 顛倒符, tentōfu)[^1] are used to correct the order of characters within a Multi-Character Form Headword. Deletion Marks (見消符, misekechifu; also called 抹消符, masshōfu)[^2] often indicate that the correct Headword is provided as a side note (e.g., 傍記 or 傍書). Interpolation Marks (補入符, honyūfu)[^3] are used to correct the order of Entries. When inputting the main text data, the text is entered in its corrected form as indicated by these correction marks, and the details of such corrections are recorded in the remarks column (which forms part of the Compiler's Remarks).\nIn the input examples that follow, detailed explanations are provided for each instance of correction or annotation. This explanatory content constitutes the Compiler's Remarks and is recorded in the remarks column of the krm_notes file.\nExample 1:\nhanzi_entry: 儻／儻 definition_elements: コヒネカハクハ remarks: Nishihata, Gosha Shorei (Examples of Scribal Errors), p. 54, item ③ \u0026ldquo;moji no irekawari\u0026rdquo; (character transposition) no. 818. Kusakawa Noboru (\u0026ldquo;Ruiju Myōgishō Wakun Shōkō,\u0026rdquo; p. 29) notes that the Kōzan-ji manuscript has a Transposition Mark on the upper right of \u0026lsquo;ヒ\u0026rsquo; in \u0026ldquo;コネヒカハクハ,\u0026rdquo; indicating the character transposition error (as pointed out by Nishihata for the Kanchi-in manuscript) had already been resolved. Example 2:\nhanzi_entry: 拻 definition_elements: 不定「ウシヽ歟」相撃 remarks: Masamune\u0026rsquo;s Index, under \u0026lsquo;ウシヽ\u0026rsquo;, notes: \u0026ldquo;Is \u0026lsquo;ウシヽ\u0026rsquo; an error for \u0026lsquo;ホシヽ\u0026rsquo;, or was the cursive form of \u0026lsquo;完\u0026rsquo; misread as \u0026lsquo;ホシヽ\u0026rsquo;? It is a lexical error.\u0026rdquo; Under \u0026lsquo;フ\u0026rsquo;, it states: \u0026ldquo;Could this be the character \u0026lsquo;不\u0026rsquo;, explained in the Jikyō dictionary as \u0026lsquo;音灰不言相撃\u0026rsquo; (pronunciation hai, unspoken, mutual strike)? This requires further research.\u0026rdquo; Kusakawa\u0026rsquo;s Wakun Shūsei records \u0026lsquo;ウシヽ\u0026rsquo; (treating it as a wakun). Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: In the original text \u0026ldquo;フ定相撃\u0026rdquo;, there is a red Deletion Mark to the left of \u0026lsquo;定\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;ウシヽ歟\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;perhaps ウシヽ?\u0026rdquo;) is written to its right in red. This is likely an editorial note (ango) added due to misidentifying a Hanzi (Chinese character) as kana. Example 3:\nhanzi_entry: ⿸𠂋帀 definition_elements: △在下 remarks: Although \u0026lsquo;△\u0026rsquo; is written in a large size similar to a Headword, it is not a Headword itself but should be regarded as an Interpolation Mark. Notational Conventions for Characters and Words # This section discusses frequently used Abbreviated Characters (略字, ryakuji), Variant Characters (itaiji) (異体字), Iteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji), Substitution Marks (代用符号, daiyō fugō), and Compound Marks (合符, gōfu).\nAbbreviated Characters (略字, ryakuji) # Abbreviated Characters (略字, ryakuji; also called 簡略字, jiǎnlüèzì in Chinese) found in the manuscript are generally normalized to their standard, common forms in the transcribed data.\nExamples: (The left side shows the abbreviated form found in the manuscript, and the right side shows the normalized character used in the data.)\n亠 → 音 (on) ﹅ → 也 (nari, ya) 彳 → 従 (jū, shitagau) 扌 → 於 (o, okeru) 乂 → 反 (han; as in fanqie 反切) 禾 → 和 (wa; as in Wa-on 和音, an older layer of Sino-Japanese pronunciation) 谷 → 俗 (zoku) (but see note below) 牜 → 物 (butsu, mono) 类 → 類 (rui) 欤 → 歟 (yo, ka) Among these, examples 1 through 4 are illustrated in the prefatory notes (凡例, hanrei) of the Myōgishō in a section explaining \u0026ldquo;注中多略用片\u0026rdquo; (meaning \u0026ldquo;in the glosses, abbreviated forms, often single components of characters [like radicals or katakana], are frequently used\u0026rdquo;).\nExample 1 (亠 for 音 \u0026lsquo;sound/pronunciation\u0026rsquo;), Example 5 (乂 for 反 \u0026lsquo;reversal\u0026rsquo;, used in fanqie spellings), and Example 6 (禾 for 和 \u0026lsquo;harmony/Japanese\u0026rsquo;, used to denote Go-on (和音, Wa-on) pronunciations) are frequently used in Phonetic Glosses.\nExample 7 (谷 for 俗) is frequently used in Notes on Character Form (to mean \u0026lsquo;popular/vulgar\u0026rsquo; form), and example 8 (牜 for 物) is frequently used in Japanese Native Readings (wakun). However, \u0026lsquo;谷\u0026rsquo; can also be used with its inherent meaning (\u0026ldquo;valley\u0026rdquo;). In such cases, it is transcribed as \u0026lsquo;谷\u0026rsquo; and not normalized to \u0026lsquo;俗\u0026rsquo;. For instance, Headwords containing \u0026lsquo;谷\u0026rsquo; as a component are listed under the \u0026lsquo;八\u0026rsquo; (eight) radical section (八部, hachibu) of the Kanchi-in manuscript. The Entry for \u0026lsquo;豅\u0026rsquo;, for example, has its semantic meaning given in the original text as \u0026ldquo;大長谷\u0026rdquo; (large long valley), so \u0026lsquo;谷\u0026rsquo; is retained as is.\nExample 9 (类 for 類) is used in Entries derived from category names in the Wamyō Ruijushō (倭名類聚抄), such as \u0026ldquo;草類\u0026rdquo; (types of grasses) and \u0026ldquo;苔類\u0026rdquo; (types of mosses).\nExample 10 (欤 for 歟) is used in notes expressing doubt or questioning the correctness of characters or phrases (these are considered types of editorial notes or ango).\nVariant Characters (itaiji) (異体字) # While care has been taken to input variant characters (itaiji) used as Headwords in a form that is faithful to, or closely approximates, their appearance in the original manuscript, the basic policy for variant characters (itaiji) appearing within the Original Glosses is to normalize them to their common or standard forms.\nExamples (Original form → Normalized form):\n𡰱 → 尼 凢 → 凡 𠩄 → 所 𢘻 → 悉 俻 → 備 Iteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji) # For Kanji Iteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji; also known as 疊字符, diézìfú in Chinese), the mark \u0026ldquo;〻\u0026rdquo; (NINOMAETEN, U+303B) is used, while \u0026ldquo;々\u0026rdquo; (DITTO MARK, U+3005) is not.\nFor iteration marks in Katakana used for Japanese Native Readings (wakun), the mark \u0026ldquo;ヽ\u0026rdquo; (KATAKANA ITERATION MARK, U+30FD) is used.\nThe marks \u0026ldquo;〱\u0026rdquo; (KUNOJITEN, U+3031), \u0026ldquo;〳\u0026rdquo; (KUNOJITEN WITH VOICED SOUND MARK, U+3033), and \u0026ldquo;〵\u0026rdquo; (KUNOJITEN WITH SEMI-VOICED SOUND MARK, U+3035) are not used; instead, the KATAKANA ITERATION MARK is repeated, such as \u0026ldquo;ヽヽ\u0026rdquo;.\nExamples:\nExample in a Headword: 曽／ー（祖）／〻（母） Example in a Japanese Native Reading (wakun): 陽　アタヽカナリ Example in a Japanese Native Reading (wakun): 倍　マスヽヽ Substitution Marks (代用符号, daiyō fugō) # The Substitution Marks (代用符号, daiyō fugō), appearing as \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; in Headwords that are compound words (熟語, jukugo), is a symbol used when substituting for an annotated character (被注字, hichūji; also 被釋字, hishakuji; i.e., the target character of an annotation) or a previously listed Headword. In the data, this \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; mark is input using \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (CHOONPU - long vowel mark, U+30FC), and the actual character it represents is then input within full-width parentheses \u0026lsquo;（）\u0026rsquo;.\nWhen the symbol \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; is used within the Original Glosses to indicate the same character as the Headword, it is simply input as \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (CHOONPU - long vowel mark, U+30FC), without an accompanying indication of the character it represents.\nExamples:\nExamples in Headwords: 五／ー（人） (here \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; substitutes for \u0026lsquo;人\u0026rsquo;), \u0026hellip;, 真／人, 漁／ー（人）, 海／ー（人） Example in Original Glosses: 鄲 邯ー縣名 (For the Headword \u0026lsquo;鄲\u0026rsquo;, the gloss \u0026ldquo;邯ー縣名\u0026rdquo; indicates that \u0026ldquo;邯ー\u0026rdquo; refers to \u0026ldquo;邯鄲\u0026rdquo;, which is a county name.) Compound Marks (合符, gōfu) # A Compound Mark (合符, gōfu; also known as 連字符, liánzìfú in some contexts, though originally a vertical linking line in the manuscript) is represented in this dataset by a hyphen-minus (\u0026rsquo;-\u0026rsquo;, U+002D). Examples of its use are relatively rare.\nExample:\nHeadword: 媊 Original Glosses (excerpt): 箭(R)貲二音　又煎(L)音　太-白-星 In the Original Glosses for the Headword \u0026lsquo;媊\u0026rsquo;, the notation \u0026ldquo;太-白-星\u0026rdquo; appears at the end. In this context, the hyphens function as Compound Marks, linking the characters \u0026lsquo;太\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;白\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;星\u0026rsquo; to form the term \u0026ldquo;太白星\u0026rdquo; (Tàibáixīng), which refers to the planet Venus.\nAdditional Notations and Layout Features # Finally, this section addresses various issues related to additional notations and layout features found in the Myōgishō. If using the Myōgishō as a resource for the historical phonology or lexicology of Japanese, it is particularly important to carefully read the explanations regarding Tone Marks (shōten), voiced sound marks (濁点, dakuten), and nasal sound symbols.\nInterlinear Notes (割注, warichū) # The basic form is warichū sōgyō (割注双行; meaning \u0026ldquo;small character definition in two lines,\u0026rdquo; comparable to 雙行夾注, shuāngháng jiāzhù in Chinese contexts), which are transcribed from right to left according to their original appearance. If an interlinear note extends to three lines, the part judged to be an addition is transcribed last.\nVariations in the Size of Characters within Original Glosses # There are rare instances where a character within the Original Glosses is mistakenly written in a large size, leading to potential confusion with a Headword.\nExample:\nhanzi_entry: 憙 definition (representing Original Glosses): 音喜（L-H）　又嬉　コノム（LLH）　喜「注也」　ネカフ (further glosses omitted) In this example, following the Headword \u0026lsquo;憙\u0026rsquo;, the Original Glosses provide a Phonetic Gloss, a Note on Character Form (implicitly, \u0026ldquo;又嬉\u0026rdquo; suggesting a variant or related form), and a Japanese Native Reading (wakun). After these, the character \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo; is written in a large size, followed by other Japanese Native Readings (wakun) such as \u0026lsquo;ネカフ\u0026rsquo;. To the right of the large character \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo;, there is a note \u0026ldquo;注也\u0026rdquo; (chū nari; \u0026ldquo;this is a gloss/annotation\u0026rdquo;), indicating that \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo; itself functions as a Semantic Gloss in Chinese for the Headword \u0026lsquo;憙\u0026rsquo;.\nSmall Character Annotations (小字注記, shōji chūki) # Annotations made using small characters are referred to as Small Character Annotations (小字注記, shōji chūki). Small Character Annotations are frequently found in Notes on Character Form (字体注, jitaichū); these are specifically termed Small Character Notes on Character Form (小字字体注記, shōji jitaichūki).\nThere are instances where a Phonetic Gloss for a Hanzi (Chinese character) used within an Original Gloss is itself annotated in an interlinear style (割注形式, warichū keishiki); this is termed a Nested Interlinear Note (再割注, saiwarichū; or 再夾注, zàijiāzhù in Chinese; meaning \u0026ldquo;smaller character definition in two lines, reapplied\u0026rdquo;).1\nAdditionally, there are cases where a Semantic Gloss in Chinese is added in small characters directly below a Japanese Native Reading (wakun); this is termed a Small Character Semantic Gloss for Wakun (小字和訓義注, shōji wakun gichū).\nSmall Character Annotations are transcribed by enclosing the relevant portion in full-width angle brackets (〈〉, U+3008 and U+3009).\nExamples:\nExample of Small Character Notes on Character Form: 又鞘〈正〉 (Found in the Notes on Character Form for the Headword \u0026lsquo;削\u0026rsquo;). Example of Nested Interlinear Note: 従夾〈公合〉成恰反 (For the Headword \u0026lsquo;陜\u0026rsquo;, the second character \u0026lsquo;夾\u0026rsquo; of the fanqie spelling is further glossed with another fanqie spelling in small characters). Example of Small Character Semantic Gloss for Wakun: アク〈髪〉 (For the Headword \u0026lsquo;結\u0026rsquo;, this note is attached to the Japanese Native Reading (wakun) \u0026lsquo;アク\u0026rsquo; to distinguish it from homonyms (開く, 厭く, 挙ぐ) and to indicate the meaning of tying up \u0026lsquo;hair\u0026rsquo; (髪)). Cases where what should have been a Small Character Semantic Gloss for Wakun was mistakenly written in the same large size as the main Original Glosses are transcribed using 〈〉, and a note to this effect is made in the remarks column (as a Compiler's Remark).\nThe following examples are shown in the order of Headword, Japanese Native Reading (wakun) (including the erroneously large annotation transcribed within 〈〉), and Compiler's Remarks.\nExamples:\nHeadword: 展 Japanese Native Reading (wakun): ヒロク〈眉〉 Compiler's Remarks: The annotation 〈眉〉 is written in a large size. Headword: 度 Japanese Native Reading (wakun): トコ〈床〉 Compiler's Remarks: The semantic gloss is written in a large size. Annotations from Variant Manuscripts (異本注記, ihon chūki) # Annotations from Variant Manuscripts (異本注記, ihon chūki) can pertain to either the Headword or the Original Glosses.\nAnnotations from Variant Manuscripts pertaining to a Headword are indicated by a preceding \u0026lsquo;▲\u0026rsquo; (U+25B2 BLACK UP-POINTING TRIANGLE) followed by the content of the annotation enclosed in Japanese quotation marks 「」.\nAnnotations from Variant Manuscripts pertaining to the Original Glosses are enclosed in full-width parentheses（）, U+FF08 and U+FF09. They are shown in the format: original character(s) in the gloss - annotation from the variant manuscript.\nThe symbol representing an \u0026ldquo;annotation from a variant manuscript\u0026rdquo; itself (異本注記) is often the Katakana character \u0026lsquo;イ\u0026rsquo; (which might be a part of the \u0026lsquo;他\u0026rsquo; character in \u0026lsquo;他本\u0026rsquo;, tahon, meaning \u0026ldquo;other manuscript,\u0026rdquo; or simply represent \u0026lsquo;異\u0026rsquo;).\nExamples:\nAnnotation from Variant Manuscripts (for a Headword): ▲𦫿「艾」 Annotation from Variant Manuscripts (for a Headword): ▲捺「⿰扌柰イ」 Annotation from Variant Manuscripts (for Original Glosses): 責猛（猛-⿰亻孟イ）二音 Source Attributions (出典注記, shutten chūki) # Book titles or personal names indicating a source are enclosed in double angle brackets (《》, U+300A and U+300B).\nExamples:\nExample of a personal name: 齔 《王右軍》作 (Here, 《王右軍》 Ō Ugun [Wang Youjun] indicates the person who created or used this form/reading). Example of a personal name: 𡫸 ◇《弘法大師》又云 (Here, ◇ indicates a note in literary Chinese placed to the right of the Headword, and 《弘法大師》 Kōbō Daishi is the cited person). Example of a book title: 它 可見《類音决》 (Here, 《類音决》 Ruionketsu is the cited book title, meaning \u0026ldquo;can be seen in the Ruionketsu\u0026rdquo;). Example of a book title: 𭘬 《大日經疏》云丁也反 (Here, 《大日經疏》 Dainichikyōsho is the cited book title, followed by a fanqie spelling). In example 2, the \u0026lsquo;◇\u0026rsquo; mark indicates that this is an annotation in literary Chinese placed to the right of the Headword.\nTone Marks (shōten) (声点) # Since Tone Marks (shōten) are a feature of great interest to users of the Myōgishō data, they are explained in detail here.\nIn the published data, the transcription of the Original Glosses is recorded in the definition_elements column of the krm_notes file. By loading krm_notes.tsv into a spreadsheet program like Excel and filtering the definition_type_name column for \u0026ldquo;Phonetic Gloss\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Japanese Native Reading (wakun)\u0026rdquo;, users can extract the relevant information.\nTypes of Tone Marks (shōten)\nTone Marks (shōten) are indicated by the abbreviations shown in parentheses: Ping/Even (L), Shang/Rising (H), Qu/Departing (R), Ru/Entering (S), Ping-Qing/Even-Light (F), and Ru-Qing/Entering-Light (T). The identification of light tones (軽声, keishō) is provisional.\nIf the position of a Tone Mark (shōten) is difficult to determine, a question mark \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; is added to indicate this uncertainty.\nVoiced sound marks and nasal sound symbols are often displayed concurrently with Tone Marks (shōten), so they are explained next.\nVoiced Sounds (濁音, dakuon)\nThe voiced sound mark (濁音符号, dakuon fugō), indicated by double dots (゛) in the original, is represented by the English letter \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo; (U+0056) in the data.\nNasal Sound Symbols (鼻音符号, bion fugō)\nThe nasal sound symbol (鼻音符号, bion fugō; also 鼻音符, bíyīnfú in Chinese) is represented by the English letter \u0026lsquo;V\u0026rsquo; (U+004E) in the data. In the manuscript, nasal sound symbols appear in forms such as ✓, v, レ, or 」. If it is necessary to refer to the specific shape of a nasal sound symbol, the check mark \u0026lsquo;✓\u0026rsquo; (U+2713) is used for explanatory purposes.\nMultiple Tone Marks (shōten)\nWhen multiple Tone Marks (shōten) are present, they are listed in the following order: Ping/Even (L) → Ping-Qing/Even-Light (F) → Shang/Rising (H) → Qu/Departing (R) → Ru-Qing/Entering-Light (T) → Ru/Entering (S). They are separated by a hyphen-minus (\u0026rsquo;-\u0026rsquo;, U+002D).\nTypes of Phonetic Glosses\nThere are three types of Phonetic Glosses:\nFanqie spellings (反切, hansetsu or fanqie), Similar sound notes (類音注, ruion-chū; annotations indicating similar pronunciations by character), and Kana glosses (仮名音注, kana-onchū; phonetic annotations in kana). Tone marks (shōten) and voiced sound indications using double-dot Tone marks (shōten) (i.e., dakuten represented via shōten placement) can be applied to Fanqie spellings, Similar sound notes, and Kana glosses. Nasal sound symbols are applied to Kana glosses.\nTypes of Japanese Native Readings (wakun)\nJapanese Native Readings (wakun) are generally written in Katakana.\nThe only exception is for \u0026lsquo;木賊\u0026rsquo; (tokusa), where the Man\u0026rsquo;yōgana \u0026lsquo;度久佐\u0026rsquo; (tokusa) is used; this instance does not have Tone marks (shōten) applied.\nJapanese Native Readings (wakun) can have Tone marks (shōten) and voiced sound indications (using double-dot shōten) applied. There is one recognized, though not entirely certain, instance of a nasal sound symbol being applied to a Japanese Native Reading (wakun) (a nasal sound symbol on \u0026lsquo;ナ\u0026rsquo; in the wakun \u0026lsquo;ナラフ\u0026rsquo; for the character \u0026lsquo;儔\u0026rsquo;).\nInput and Processing Methods for Tone Marks (shōten), Voiced Sound Marks, and Nasal Sound Symbols\nTone Marks (shōten) and voiced sound indications (using double-dot shōten) are applied to Hanzi (Chinese characters) or to Japanese Native Readings (wakun) written in Katakana. Nasal sound symbols are applied to Phonetic Glosses in Katakana (i.e., Kana glosses) or to Japanese Native Readings (wakun) in Katakana.\nFor Fanqie spellings (反切, hansetsu), which consist of an initial character (反切上字, hansetsu jōji) and a final character (反切下字, hansetsu kaji), any applied Tone Marks (shōten) are converted to their corresponding symbols (e.g., L, H) and enclosed in full-width parentheses（）.\nSimilar sound notes (類音注, ruion-chū) are also enclosed in full-width parentheses（）.\nKana glosses (仮名音注, kana-onchū), when written in small characters around fanqie spellings or similar sound notes, are enclosed in Japanese quotation marks 「」. However, if a Kana gloss is explicitly prefixed with \u0026ldquo;呉\u0026rdquo; (Go, for Go-on) or \u0026ldquo;和\u0026rdquo; (Wa, for Wa-on) within the main text of the Original Glosses, the quotation marks 「」 are omitted.\nFor Phonetic Glosses, Tone Marks (shōten), voiced sound marks, and nasal sound symbols are recorded on a per-Hanzi (Chinese character) basis (i.e., for each single character). For Japanese Native Readings (wakun), these marks are recorded for the entire word or phrase.\nPartial Application of Tone Marks (shōten)\nIf Tone Marks (shōten) are applied to only a part of a Japanese Native Reading (wakun), the parts without Tone Marks (shōten) are indicated by a half-width underscore (\u0026rsquo;_\u0026rsquo;, U+005F). (This typically means Hanzi (Chinese characters) are treated one by one, while a wakun is treated as a whole unit for tone marking, with underscores for unmarked morae/syllables if only part of it is marked).\nExamples:\n偵 勅令（R）反 使 所里（H）所使（H）二反 㒓 達（S）音 僆 輦（H）練（R）二音 偶 音藕（HV）「コウ」 侮 音武（L-HV）「フ」「ム（H）」 拱 呉音恐（L） 捉 呉冊（S） サク（_L） 類 和ルイ（_L） 形 和キヤウ（N_H-N） Examples 1 and 2 are Fanqie spellings. Examples 3 and 4 are Similar sound notes. Examples 5 and 6 are Similar sound notes accompanied by Kana glosses.\nExamples 7 and 8 are Go-on (呉音) readings; example 7 is a Similar sound note, while example 8 is a Similar sound note accompanied by a Kana gloss.\nExamples 9 and 10 are Wa-on (和音) readings; example 9 has Tone Marks (shōten) recorded, while example 10 has both Tone Marks (shōten) and nasal sound symbols.\n\u0026ldquo;Regarding Tone Marks (shōten), while distinguishing between those written in red ink (朱点, shuten – also referred to by some specialists as Vermilion Glosses) and those written in black ink (墨点, bokuten) is important, this distinction has not been made in the current data input.

These include Tone marks (shōten) and Katakana phonetic annotations directly applied to the Headword to indicate Sino-Japanese readings; side-line kun readings (傍訓, bōkun) and kaeriten marks (返点, kaeriten) directly applied to the Headword to indicate Japanese native readings and reading order; and annotations from variant manuscripts found at the end of the Original Glosses (but pertaining to the Headword). These will be explained together here.\nTone Marks (shōten) and Katakana Phonetic Annotations for Headwords\nTone marks (shōten) and Katakana phonetic script applied to a Headword to indicate its Sino-Japanese reading are transcribed at the beginning of the Original Glosses. They are preceded by a double circle (◎, U+25CE) and the annotated character (被注字, hichūji), followed immediately by the annotation. Tone marks (shōten) are represented by their abbreviations within full-width parentheses （）, and Katakana phonetic script is enclosed in Japanese quotation marks 「」.\nSide-Line Kun Readings, Kaeriten Marks, and Other Annotations for Headwords\nSide-line kun readings (傍訓, bōkun) and kaeriten marks applied to a Headword to indicate its Japanese native reading and reading order are transcribed immediately following the annotated character, preceded by a bullseye mark (⦿, U+29BF) and the annotated character, and enclosed in 「」. Annotations in literary Chinese (such as Fanqie spellings, Semantic Glosses in Chinese, Notes on Character Form, or Source Attributions) applied to a Headword are transcribed immediately following the annotated character, preceded by a lozenge/diamond mark (◇, U+25C7) and the annotated character, and enclosed in 「」. Annotations from Variant Manuscripts applied to a Headword are transcribed immediately following the annotated character, preceded by a black up-pointing triangle (▲, U+25B2) and the annotated character, and enclosed in 「」.\nAnnotations from Variant Manuscripts at the End of Original Glosses\nAnnotations from Variant Manuscripts pertaining to the Headword but added at the end of the Original Glosses are indicated by a preceding \u0026lsquo;▲\u0026rsquo; at the end of the glosses, with the content of the annotation enclosed in 「」.\nOrder of Transcription\nIf it is necessary to transcribe multiple types of Supplementary Headword Annotations for a single Headword, they are recorded in the following order: ◎ Sino-Japanese reading information, ⦿ Japanese native reading information / reading order marks, ◇ Annotations in literary Chinese, ▲ Annotations from variant manuscripts.\nExamples:\n◎純「ト（L）ン（H）」 ⦿虱「キサヽ」 ◇⿱惟乃「手歟」 ▲⿲骨石辛「𩪧イ」 Other Noteworthy Cases # Decipherment Notes (判読注, handoku-chū)\nA compiler\u0026rsquo;s decipherment note (解讀注記, jiědú zhùjì in Chinese) may be indicated by enclosing it in parentheses ().\nExample:\n⿰阝⿱𠂉夕 オチイル（L___、ホを見消してチ） (This hanzi_entry (⿰阝⿱𠂉夕) is followed by its Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*) \u0026lsquo;オチイル\u0026rsquo; with Tone Marks and a decipherment note \u0026ldquo;ホを見消してチ\u0026rdquo; [meaning \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;ホ\u0026rsquo; is deleted and replaced by \u0026lsquo;チ\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;].) For this example, the following content would be recorded in the remarks column (as a Compiler's Remark):\nMasamune\u0026rsquo;s Index, under \u0026lsquo;オホ（-ヒ）チイル\u0026rsquo;, notes: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;ホ（-ヒ）\u0026rsquo; is a mark indicating \u0026lsquo;ホ\u0026rsquo; was deleted. Should it be \u0026lsquo;オチイル\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo; Kusakawa\u0026rsquo;s Wakun Shūsei records \u0026lsquo;オホ\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;チイル\u0026rsquo; separately. Mochizuki\u0026rsquo;s Wakun Shūsei records \u0026lsquo;オチイル\u0026rsquo;. Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: Follow Masamune and Mochizuki.\nFanqie Spellings within Headwords\nIf a Fanqie spelling is inserted within a Multi-Character Form Headword (typically an idiom/compound), a forward slash \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; (half-width slash) is used to indicate the separation.\nExample:\n𣚊ー（棗） 人充　/　ノナツメ（_HHH） In this example, which shows the Headword followed by its Original Glosses, the Fanqie spelling \u0026ldquo;人充\u0026rdquo; is written directly beneath \u0026lsquo;𣚊\u0026rsquo; (the first part of the Headword \u0026lsquo;𣚊ー（棗）\u0026rsquo;).\nJapanese Native Readings (wakun) Attached to Hanzi (Chinese characters) within Original Glosses\nSmall Katakana characters (representing Japanese Native Readings (wakun)) attached to a Hanzi (Chinese character) within the Original Glosses are transcribed as is, enclosed in Japanese quotation marks 「」. If such a wakun is written in even smaller characters (小字, shōji), it is enclosed in full-width angle brackets 〈〉. Examples of the latter are rare.\nExamples:\n琢「ミカク」玉工也 圏〈ヲリ〉 ー「タヘ」「平歟」趹「ハシル」追「ヲオフ」蹤「ニクルヲ」 Example 1 is seen within the Original Glosses for the Headword \u0026lsquo;玊\u0026rsquo;; the Japanese Native Reading (wakun) \u0026lsquo;ミカク\u0026rsquo; is attached to the right side of the character \u0026lsquo;琢\u0026rsquo;.\nExample 2 is seen within the Original Glosses for the Headword \u0026lsquo;檻\u0026rsquo;; the Japanese Native Reading (wakun) is attached below \u0026lsquo;圏\u0026rsquo; in small characters.\nExample 3 is seen within the Original Glosses for the Headword \u0026lsquo;要\u0026rsquo;. It shows example sentences (or phrases) and their Japanese Native Readings (wakun).\nThe term 再割注 (saiwarichū), or 再夾注 (zàijiāzhù in Chinese), implies a \u0026ldquo;re-application\u0026rdquo; of an interlinear-style gloss, often to a character already within a gloss.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/en/docs/krm/04-entry-input/","title":"Input of Entry Data","section":"Ruiju Myogisho","content":" Input of Entry Data # This document explains how to input Entry data for the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō.

However, an Entry can also be identified as containing variant character information based on its relationship with preceding and succeeding Entries, even without explicit Form Classification Tags.\nHere, the term jitaichūki (字体注記, translated in this document primarily as \u0026ldquo;Form Classification Tag\u0026rdquo;) directly refers to descriptive terms indicating the type or normative status of a character form, such as \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; (standard), \u0026ldquo;俗\u0026rdquo; (popular/vulgar), and \u0026ldquo;通\u0026rdquo; (common). This concept is comparable to what Nishihara Kazuyuki refers to as jitaikihan (字体規範) and Lee Kyeong Won calls \u0026ldquo;字級\u0026rdquo; (zìjí). In English, Nishihara\u0026rsquo;s jitaikihan is close to a \u0026ldquo;Glyph Standard Label,\u0026rdquo; and Lee\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;字級\u0026rdquo; is similar to a \u0026ldquo;Form Classification Tag.\u0026rdquo; For the purposes of this document, \u0026ldquo;Form Classification Tag\u0026rdquo; will be the primary English term used to convey a meaning similar to Lee\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;字級\u0026rdquo; (correlating with the Japanese jitaichūki).\nAn Entry with Variant Character Information refers to Entries where multiple Headwords are listed together to indicate variant characters (*itaiji*), or where Form Classification Tags such as \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; (standard) and \u0026ldquo;俗\u0026rdquo; (popular/vulgar) are provided within the Original Glosses.\nVariant characters (itaiji) may be collated in consecutive Entries in single-character form, with Form Classification Tags provided in their Original Glosses. Alternatively, they may be included as variant forms within a single Entry in multi-character form, again with Form Classification Tags in the Original Glosses.\nAn Entry can also be identified as an Entry with Variant Character Information based on its relationship with preceding and succeeding Entries, even without explicit Form Classification Tags.\nAn Entry is determined to be an Entry with Variant Character Information based on the content of the Form Classification Tags (such as \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; standard and \u0026ldquo;俗\u0026rdquo; popular/vulgar) found in the Original Glosses, or by the relationship between the listed Headwords.\nCurrently, while we are unable to provide precise figures, our estimates suggest that out of the approximately 32,600 Entries in the Kanchi-in manuscript, around 14,000 are Entries with Variant Character Information. Among these, approximately 9,500 are expected to be in single-character form, and about 4,500 in multi-character form.\nNext, we will explain this with specific examples.\nExamples:\nExample with Form Classification Tags: 槎査　上通下正 Example with Form Classification Tags: 㔽卣　今正 Example without Form Classification Tags: 若𠰥　音弱（SV）「シヤク」　モシ（RL）　… Example without Form Classification Tags: 政⿰正攴 之盛反　マツリコト（HHHH_） … Example with Partially Missing Form Classification Tags: 溺字　キヨシ（LL_）　タヽヨフ （無） In Example 1, from the Original Glosses \u0026ldquo;上通下正,\u0026rdquo; it is stated that the Headword \u0026ldquo;槎\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;通\u0026rdquo; (common) and \u0026ldquo;査\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; (standard), indicating that \u0026ldquo;槎\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;査\u0026rdquo; are listed together as Headwords in a variant character (*itaiji*) relationship.\nSimilarly, in Example 2, from the Original Glosses \u0026ldquo;今正,\u0026rdquo; it is stated that the Headword \u0026ldquo;㔽\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;今\u0026rdquo; (current/present form) and \u0026ldquo;卣\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; (standard), allowing us to identify this as an Entry with Variant Character Information.\nExamples 3 and 4 are cases where no Form Classification Tags are visible in the Original Glosses. In Example 3, the difference between \u0026ldquo;若\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;𠰥\u0026rdquo; is a minimal variation between \u0026ldquo;艹\u0026rdquo; (grass radical) and \u0026ldquo;䒑\u0026rdquo; (grass head). Similarly, in Example 4, the difference between \u0026ldquo;政\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;⿰正攴\u0026rdquo; is a slight variation between \u0026ldquo;攵\u0026rdquo; (knock radical) and \u0026ldquo;攴\u0026rdquo; (tap/rap radical). In both cases, it is clear that they are in a variant character (itaiji) relationship.\nIn Example 5, while has the note \u0026ldquo;溺字\u0026rdquo; (indicating, as per the Guangyun, that 㲻 is an ancient form of 溺 \u0026lsquo;drowning\u0026rsquo; [\u0026ldquo;古作㲻\u0026rdquo;]), the subsequent Entry lacks Original Glosses. This example involves \u0026ldquo;㲻\u0026rdquo; and its variant character (itaiji), so GlyphWiki is used to display them to clarify their difference.\nIdiom Entries # An Idiom Entry (熟語項目) is one where the Headword is in multi-character form and constitutes an idiom. While an Entry is clearly an Idiom Entry if there is an explanation of the Headword as an idiom in the Original Glosses, it is also considered an Idiom Entry even when there is no such explanation and Phonetic Glosses and Semantic Glosses in Chinese are provided for each character of the Headword.\nCurrently, while precise figures are not available, the estimated numbers for Idiom Entries are as follows:\nOut of the approximately 32,600 Entries in the Kanchi-in manuscript, around 14,000 are Entries with Variant Character Information, meaning that approximately 18,600 Entries are not Entries with Variant Character Information. Among these approximately 18,600 Entries, about 15,000 are in single-character form, and 3,500 are in multi-character form. These multi-character form Entries are projected to be Idiom Entries. The remaining approximately 100 Entries are those for which the Entry type cannot be determined based on their content.\nNext, we will provide specific examples.\nExamples:\n凡ー（俗） タヽヒト（LLV__）　ワロ人（LL_） 苾蒭　上蒲（L）「ホ」結（S）反　古馝字　香草也　カウハシ　又毗必反　下音鶵　草之惣名　クサ　*カラクサ　ワラ 齟齬　上慈呂（H）反　嚼　ナヤマシ（LL__） 菡萏　上胡感反　下徒感反　ーー〔菡萏〕　ハチスノハナ In Example 1, for the idiom \u0026ldquo;凡俗,\u0026rdquo; the Japanese Native Readings (wakun) \u0026ldquo;タヽヒト\u0026rdquo; (tatabito) and \u0026ldquo;ワロ人\u0026rdquo; (warobito) are listed.\nIn Example 2, for the idiom \u0026ldquo;苾蒭,\u0026rdquo; Phonetic Glosses, Semantic Glosses in Chinese, and Japanese Native Readings (wakun) are provided for both the first character \u0026ldquo;苾\u0026rdquo; and the second character \u0026ldquo;蒭.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Example 3, for the idiom \u0026ldquo;齟齬,\u0026rdquo; a Phonetic Gloss, a Semantic Gloss in Chinese, and a Japanese Native Reading (wakun) are provided for the first character \u0026ldquo;齟.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Example 4, for the idiom \u0026ldquo;菡萏,\u0026rdquo; Phonetic Glosses are provided for both the first character \u0026ldquo;菡\u0026rdquo; and the second character \u0026ldquo;萏,\u0026rdquo; followed by the Japanese Native Reading (wakun) \u0026ldquo;ハチスノハナ\u0026rdquo; (hachisunohana - lotus flower) for the idiom \u0026ldquo;菡萏.\u0026rdquo;\nBasic Entries and Extended Entries # Based on the format of the Original Glosses, Headword Entries are divided into Basic Entries, in which all information regarding the \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo; (形), \u0026ldquo;sound\u0026rdquo; (音), and \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; (義) of the Headword is recorded, and Extended Entries, which are all other Entries.\n\u0026ldquo;Form\u0026rdquo; is represented by the Headword itself and Form Classification Tags, \u0026ldquo;sound\u0026rdquo; by Phonetic Glosses, and \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; by Semantic Glosses in Chinese and Japanese Native Readings (wakun).\nBasic Entries can be either in single-character or multi-character form. Extended Entries are, in terms of format, considered to follow Basic Entries.\nIn terms of content, Extended Entries include those in which only a part of the \u0026ldquo;form,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sound,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;meaning\u0026rdquo; of the Headword is recorded. However, even Entries without Original Glosses or with \u0026ldquo;unknown\u0026rdquo; (未詳) noted in the Original Glosses are included as Extended Entries if some kind of relationship is recognized between them and the preceding or succeeding Entries.\nCurrently, while precise figures are not available, our estimates suggest that out of the approximately 32,600 Entries in the Kanchi-in manuscript, around 15,100 are expected to be Basic Entries and approximately 17,000 are projected to be Extended Entries. The remaining approximately 500 Entries have weak relationships with other Entries and are presumed to have been arranged temporarily or for convenience.\nNext, we will provide specific examples.\nExamples:\nBasic Entry: 人　音仁（LV）「ニン」　ヒト（HL）　ワレ（LL）　サネ　マホル　ユク Extended Entry: 一人　ヒトリ（LH_） Extended Entry: 二人　フタリ（HHL） Independent Entries and Serial Entries # Headword Entries are divided, based on whether a Basic Entry has Extended Entries, into Independent Entries, which consist only of a Basic Entry without any Extended Entries, and Serial Entries, which consist of both a Basic Entry and one or more Extended Entries. Within a Serial Entry, the Basic Entry is sometimes referred to as the Chief Entry, and the Extended Entries as Sub Entries.\nThe number of Independent Entries and Serial Entries has not yet been calculated.\nIndependent Entries are exemplified by the following:\nExamples:\n仕　音士　ツカフ（HHL）　ツカマツル（HL___）　ミヤツカヘ　ツモム 任　音壬（LV）「シム」「ニム」　タヘタリ（LR__、ヘ-フ）　… Although \u0026ldquo;仕\u0026rdquo; (to serve) and \u0026ldquo;任\u0026rdquo; (to entrust) have similar graphic forms, they are distinct Chinese characters, and each functions as a Basic Entry with its own Phonetic Glosses and Japanese Native Readings (wakun). However, no variant characters (itaiji) of \u0026ldquo;仕\u0026rdquo; or compound words containing \u0026ldquo;仕\u0026rdquo; are found. Similarly, no related variant characters (itaiji) or compound words are found for \u0026ldquo;任.\u0026rdquo;\nSerial Entries are exemplified by \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; (person) as the Basic Entry and \u0026ldquo;一人\u0026rdquo; (one person), \u0026ldquo;二人\u0026rdquo; (two people) as the Extended Entries, as shown in the examples for Basic Entries and Extended Entries. \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; is the Chief Entry, and \u0026ldquo;一人\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;二人\u0026rdquo; are the Sub Entries.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/en/docs/krm/03-entry-data-model/03-03-concepts-char/","title":"Concepts Related to Character Notation","section":"Entry Data Model","content":" Concepts Related to Character Notation # Script Styles, Character Standards, and Character Shapes # The terms \u0026ldquo;書体\u0026rdquo; (shotai, script style), \u0026ldquo;字体\u0026rdquo; (jitai, character standard), and \u0026ldquo;字形\u0026rdquo; (jikei, character shape) as used in this document primarily follow the definitions provided by Ishizuka Harumichi in Zushoryōbon Nihon Shoki Kenkyūhen (Tokyo: Kyūko Shoin, 1984). The following English explanations are translations from Ishizuka\u0026rsquo;s original Japanese definitions:\nScript Style (shotai): A socially common style existing in the form of Hanzi (Chinese characters). It is often determined by the purpose of the material in which the characters appear (e.g., 楷書 Kaisho [regular script], 草書 Sōsho [cursive script]). (Original Japanese: 書体 \u0026mdash; 漢字の形に於て存在する社会共通の様式。多くは其の漢字資料の目的により決まる。楷書・草書等) Character Standard (jitai): A socially common standard for each Hanzi (Chinese character) existing within a given shotai (script style). (Original Japanese: 字体 \u0026mdash; 書体内に於て存在する一々の漢字の社会共通の基準) Character Shape (jikei): The actual written shape itself of each Hanzi (Chinese character) as realized or recognized within a given jitai (character standard). (Original Japanese: 字形 \u0026mdash; 字体内に於て認識する一々の漢字の書写された形そのもの) A key feature of these definitions is their hierarchical understanding of shotai, jitai, and jikei.\nThe English definitions provided by Ishizuka et al. are as follows1:\n書體 (Shotai): Socially common form of the type of a Chinese character. In many instances, the usage of a particular type is determined by the purpose of writing, 楷書, 草書, etc. 字體 (Jitai): Socially common standard of writing Chinese character existing within the 書體. 字形 (Jikei): Shape itself of a Chinese character as recognized within the standard of the 字體. Based on these English explanations (from Ishizuka et al., 2003, which are consistent with the translated 1984 definitions), this document will use the following English terms:\nFor 「書體（書体）」: Script Styles (shotai) (書体) For 「字體（字体）」: Standard of Writing Chinese Characters (jitai) (字体) For 「字形」: Shapes of Chinese Characters (jikei) (字形) Variant Characters (異体字) # The term Variant Characters (itaiji) (異体字) is, at the level of Character Standards (iitai) (字体), a concept corresponding to \u0026ldquo;Standard Characters (seiji)\u0026rdquo; (正字). In models of the historical study of Chinese character forms, such as those presented by Ishizuka Harumichi in \u0026ldquo;Kanji Jitai no Nihonteki Hyōjun\u0026rdquo; (Japanese Standards of Chinese Character Forms; Kokugo to Kokubungaku 76, no. 5, 1999), the standard for Chinese character forms is considered to have changed according to period and region. The Hanzi Normative Glyphs Database (HNG) was intended to empirically demonstrate this model. Related data, including materials from its predecessor (the Ishizuka Register of Chinese Character Standards of Writing), can be accessed via the Hanzi Normative Glyphs Dataset available at https://www.hng-data.org.\nWhile \u0026ldquo;Variant Characters\u0026rdquo; are generally understood to refer to character forms that are not \u0026ldquo;Standard Characters,\u0026rdquo; Ishizuka\u0026rsquo;s model posits that the standard for Chinese character forms—that is, the \u0026ldquo;Standard Character\u0026quot;—differs by period and region, making it impossible to distinguish a priori between \u0026ldquo;Standard Characters\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Variant Characters (itaiji).\u0026rdquo; In this document, we consider Variant Characters (itaiji) as variations of Chinese character forms. We judge that a character indicates a variant if it is accompanied by Form Classification Tags (字体注記, jitaichūki, also referred to as 字級, zìjí) such as \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; (standard), \u0026ldquo;俗\u0026rdquo; (popular/vulgar), \u0026ldquo;通\u0026rdquo; (common), or \u0026ldquo;或\u0026rdquo; (alternative).\nThe practice of calling Form Classification Tags like \u0026ldquo;正\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;俗\u0026rdquo; zìjí (字級) follows Lee Kyeong Won in his Zui-Tang Ziyangxue Yanjiu (隋唐字様學研究; A Study of Sui and Tang Dynasty Character Lexicography; PhD diss., National Taiwan Normal University, Graduate Institute of Chinese, 1997).\nGraphically Similar Characters (形近字) # Graphically Similar Characters (keikinki) (形近字) are distinct characters that have similar visual forms. They are also known as ruikei betsuji (類形別字) or ruikei iji (類形異字) (distinct characters of similar form). In the study of the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō, Sakai Kenji, in his article “Ruiju Myōgishō no Jijun to Bushu Hairetsu” (Character Order and Radical Arrangement in the Ruiju Myōgishō),2 identified an \u0026ldquo;arrangement by similar character forms\u0026rdquo; (類似字形排列, ruiji jikei hairetsu) within radical sections.

This particular Entry has complex content within its Original Glosses; its Phonetic Gloss includes multiple Tone marks (shōten), Sino-Japanese readings in kana (仮名字音, kana jion), and nasal sound symbols. (In the provided transcription format, details such as the distinction between circle and star types of Tone marks (shōten), or the use of red versus black ink to differentiate Tone marks (shōten) from Sino-Japanese readings in kana, are not represented.) The Semantic Gloss in Chinese \u0026lsquo;續也\u0026rsquo; is a scribal error for \u0026lsquo;績也\u0026rsquo;. The Japanese Native Reading (wakun) \u0026lsquo;タシカニ\u0026rsquo; (tashikani) is questionable as it does not correspond to the semantic meaning of the Headword \u0026lsquo;功\u0026rsquo;. Immediately following this wakun, there is a note \u0026lsquo;𭃄歟\u0026rsquo; (setsu ka; \u0026ldquo;perhaps 𭃄?\u0026rdquo;), and indeed, the character \u0026lsquo;切\u0026rsquo; has the wakun \u0026lsquo;タシカニ\u0026rsquo; (tashikani). The character \u0026lsquo;功\u0026rsquo; has a variant character (itaiji) \u0026lsquo;㓛\u0026rsquo;, which is graphically similar to \u0026lsquo;切\u0026rsquo; and its variant character (itaiji) \u0026lsquo;𭃄\u0026rsquo;. \u0026lsquo;切\u0026rsquo; is a graphically similar character to the Headword \u0026lsquo;功\u0026rsquo;, and this particular wakun is thought to have resulted from confusion between these two graphically similar characters. However, instead of altering the content of the Original Glosses, the note \u0026lsquo;𭃄歟\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;perhaps 𭃄?\u0026rdquo;) was added by the compiler or scribe. Such notes appended with \u0026lsquo;歟\u0026rsquo; (ka), like \u0026lsquo;𭃄歟\u0026rsquo;, are treated as \u0026rsquo;editorial notes\u0026rsquo; (ango, 案語) by the original compiler or a later scribe of the Myōgishō.\nEntry 2, \u0026lsquo;Headword\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;助\u0026rsquo; (whose original form is ⿰目力 in this Entry), is in Single Character Form and provides a Phonetic Gloss and Japanese Native Readings (wakun). The subsequent Entry 3, \u0026lsquo;Headword\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;𦔳／助\u0026rsquo;, is in Multi-Character Form and indicates variant characters (itaiji) through a Note on Character Form (\u0026ldquo;今正\u0026rdquo;). The \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo; (full-width slash) is a separator used for Multi-Character Form Headwords. The number of characters in such a Headword can be determined from the number of segments separated by these slashes (e.g., one slash indicates two characters).\nEntry 4, \u0026lsquo;Headword\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;加／復\u0026rsquo;, presents a Japanese Native Reading (wakun) for a compound term. Entry 5, \u0026lsquo;Headword\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;ー（加）／之\u0026rsquo;, indicates that it shares the same wakun (\u0026lsquo;同\u0026rsquo;). The \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; in \u0026lsquo;ー（加）／之\u0026rsquo; is a symbol used to concisely represent \u0026lsquo;加\u0026rsquo;, the first character of the Headword in the preceding Entry (Entry 4, \u0026lsquo;加／復\u0026rsquo;).\nThe same content is shown below in JSON format.

The repository can be accessed at https://github.com/shikeda.\nA summary of the Chinese character dictionaries included in the HDIC and the initial publication dates of their full-text databases is as follows:\nSōhon Gyokuhen (宋本玉篇, Songben Yupian; abbr. SYP) – First published: October 20, 2015 Kōsan-ji manuscript Tenrei Banshō Meigi (篆隷万象名義; abbr. KTB) – First published: September 1, 2016 Tenji manuscript Shinsen Jikyō (新撰字鏡; abbr. TSJ) – First published: June 28, 2018 Kanchi-in manuscript Ruiju Myōgisho (類聚名義抄; abbr. KRM) – First published: March 11, 2022 An explanation of what GitHub is and the significance of publishing research data through this system can be summarized as follows:\nGitHub is widely used as a platform for managing and publishing software source code. In recent years, however, it has also been utilized in various research fields, including the humanities, for sharing and publishing research data. GitHub is built upon a version control system called \u0026ldquo;Git,\u0026rdquo; which records the entire editing history and clearly preserves the an audit trail of changes. This makes it possible to track who made what changes and when, thereby enhancing the transparency and reproducibility of research data.\nFurthermore, GitHub facilitates collaborative editing among multiple individuals. Features such as pull requests and issues allow for dialogue and peer-review-like interactions with other researchers to be recorded. Its appeal also lies in features like document creation using Markdown notation and the ability to view file-specific revision histories, making it relatively easy to use even for humanities researchers who do not write programs.\nThe significance of placing data on GitHub extends beyond mere storage. It enables \u0026ldquo;open science\u0026rdquo; practices, where research progress is incrementally published, and improvements are made based on external feedback. It is particularly well-suited for structured humanities data, such as data on Sino-Japanese character readings (like Kan-on and Go-on based on historical sources), transcribed texts, and lexicographical information, with many existing examples of its use.\nMoreover, data on GitHub can be linked with Zenodo, a research data repository, to assign a formal DOI (Digital Object Identifier) and publish it in an academically stable manner. For instance, the \u0026ldquo;Database of Historical Sino-Japanese Readings\u0026rdquo; (DHSJR) utilizes GitHub for data construction, and this data is then registered with Zenodo and published with a DOI, making it internationally citable and reusable. In this way, GitHub is playing a significant role as a foundation for the long-term sharing and utilization of digital resources in the humanities.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-01-main/","title":"krm_main","section":"Overview of Published Data","content":" krm_main # Overview and file formats # This section describes the core files of the database for the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō (hereinafter \u0026ldquo;Myōgishō\u0026rdquo;).\nPreviously, the released file was a TSV file named KRM.tsv.\nIt contains information regarding Headwords, the full content of the Definition (Original Glosses), volume, radical, and the locations in the Kazama Shobō edition and the Tenri Central Library/Yōtokusha (Tenri Zenhon Sōsho) edition.\nIn March 2025, the specifications for column names and the display method for Tone marks (*shōten*) were updated.

(Corresponds to 第1帖仏上 to 第10帖僧下). hanzi_entry The collated Headword (校訂漢字) principally uses Kangxi Dictionary form, including Unicode simplified Chinese characters (common-use forms, popular variants). For Chinese characters not included in Unicode, they are represented by the following methods: If representable by combining Chinese character components, input using IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence). For specific Chinese characters or their components, if representation by IDS or standard Unicode is difficult, use simplified notations based on the entity reference systems of CHISE and GlyphWiki (e.g., CDP-8C55, koseki-00001). Chinese characters not representable by any of the above methods, or characters unreadable in the original text (due to damage such as wormholes, etc.), are input as \u0026lsquo;■\u0026rsquo; (black square). Headwords consisting of multiple Chinese characters are separated by \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo; (full-width slash). The abbreviation symbol \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; is indicated by \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (long vowel mark), and the corresponding character is appended in full-width parentheses (). original_entry Headword based on the original character form. Typographical errors in the original are preserved. The representation of Chinese characters outside Unicode follows the rules for hanzi_entry. If the original-form Headword is not needed, \u0026lsquo;〇\u0026rsquo; is used. definition The content of this definition column represents the Definition (Original Glosses). It includes Notes on Character Form, Phonetic Glosses, Semantic Glosses in Chinese, Japanese Native Readings (*wakun*), and Other relevant information, separated by spaces.

Details of the rules for assigning Character order are defined separately. tenri_location An ID indicating T + Volume (a/b/c) + Tenri Edition Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character order (字順, jijun) (1 digit). Details of the rules for assigning Character order are defined separately. volume_name Name of the volume, consisting of 10 volumes: 仏上, 仏中, 仏下本, 仏下末, 法上, 法中, 法下, 僧上, 僧中, and 僧下. radical_name Name of the radical, consisting of 120 radicals ranging from 人 to 雑, used to classify Hanzi (Chinese characters). volume_radical_index Volume and radical number, ranging from v1#1 (Volume 1, Radical 1) to v10#120 (Volume 10, Radical 120), indicating the location of the Entry within the text. (Corresponds to 第1帖仏上 to 第10帖僧下). hanzi_entry The collated Headword (校訂漢字) principally uses Kangxi Dictionary form, including Unicode simplified Chinese characters (common-use forms, popular variants). For Chinese characters not included in Unicode, they are represented by the following methods: If representable by combining Chinese character components, input using IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence). For specific Chinese characters or their components, if representation by IDS or standard Unicode is difficult, use simplified notations based on the entity reference systems of CHISE and GlyphWiki (e.g., CDP-8C55, koseki-00001). Chinese characters not representable by any of the above methods, or characters unreadable in the original text (due to damage such as wormholes, etc.), are input as \u0026lsquo;■\u0026rsquo; (black square). Headwords consisting of multiple Chinese characters are separated by \u0026lsquo;／\u0026rsquo; (full-width slash). The abbreviation symbol \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; is indicated by \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (long vowel mark), and the corresponding character is appended in full-width parentheses (). original_entry Headword based on the original character form. Typographical errors in the original are preserved. The representation of Chinese characters outside Unicode follows the rules for hanzi_entry. If the original-form Headword is not needed, \u0026lsquo;〇\u0026rsquo; is used. definition_elements Extracted individual elements from the full Definition (Original Glosses), classified into five types: Notes on Character Form, Phonetic Gloss, Semantic Gloss in Chinese, Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*), and Other information. Each record in krm_notes typically corresponds to one such extracted element. definition_type_code A 3-digit numeric code representing the type of element from the Definition (Original Glosses). definition_type_name Indicates which of the five following categories the element from the Definition (Original Glosses) belongs to: Notes on Character Form, Phonetic Gloss, Semantic Gloss in Chinese, Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*), or Other information. remarks Compiler's Remarks: Notes by the database compilers providing additional context, scholarly observations, results of textual collation, or source investigations related to the specific definition_element or Headword. Content and Significance of Compiler\u0026rsquo;s Remarks (the remarks Column) # Please note that this remarks column stores the Compiler's Remarks (annotations by the database creators).\nThe remarks column provides the following types of information:\nAdditional context: Supplementary background or related information that aids in understanding the Myōgishō\u0026rsquo;s entries. Scholarly observations: Philological, linguistic, or other expert perspectives on specific descriptions, including references to previous research. Results of textual collation: Findings from comparisons with variant manuscripts or related materials, and textual interpretations based on these collations. Source investigations: Results and considerations regarding the textual sources of the Myōgishō\u0026rsquo;s entries, including references to findings from previous studies. These remarks are each associated with one of the following specific parts of a Myōgishō Entry:\nA specific definition_element (an individual component of the Definition (Original Glosses)): This refers to a distinct element within the Myōgishō\u0026rsquo;s original annotation for an Entry (such as a particular Note on Character Form, Phonetic Gloss, Semantic Gloss in Chinese, or Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*)), as itemized in the krm_notes file. Or the Headword: The main character(s) of the Entry. In essence, the remarks column serves to provide specialized, supplementary information from the database compilers, enabling a deeper understanding and facilitating further research that goes beyond what can be gleaned from the Myōgishō\u0026rsquo;s main text and original glosses alone.\n"},{"id":15,"href":"/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-03-headword-chars/","title":"krm_headword_chars","section":"Overview of Published Data","content":" krm_headword_chars # Overview and file formats # Headwords in the Myōgishō can consist of single Chinese characters or multiple Chinese characters (multi-character compounds). The krm_headword_chars data file provides a list of all constituent characters that form these Headwords from the Myōgishō. The characters are ordered according to the sequence of Entries (items) in the Myōgishō and then by the order of appearance of characters within each Headword.\nIn the Myōgishō database, the primary data file krm_main, the krm_notes file (containing data for Compiler's Remarks), and the krm_wakun file (Japanese Native Reading (*wakun*) data) are all structured on an Entry-by-Entry basis. Consequently, for Headwords composed of multiple Chinese characters, any character subsequent to the first cannot be directly referenced from these particular data files.\nTo search for Headwords from the Myōgishō character by character, display their original manuscript images, or perform analyses at the individual Chinese character level, a complete list of all constituent characters of the Headwords, including those from the second character onwards in multi-character compounds, is necessary.\nThe krm_headword_chars data file was created for this purpose. This data is provided in TSV and JSON formats. Each row (or record) corresponds to a single constituent character of a Headword and includes information such as: the sequential ID of the Headword (single or multi-character) in the Myōgishō to which the constituent character belongs (hanzi_id); the ID of the Myōgishō Entry to which this character\u0026rsquo;s Headword belongs (entry_id); the order of the character within its Headword (character_order); the character itself (constituent_char); the file name of the individually cropped image for the character (img_file_name); and location information for that character in both the Kazama and Tenri editions (kazama_location_id, tenri_location_id). This enables information access at the individual character level while allowing linkage with Entry-based data files such as krm_main.\nDescription of each column # The column names and their descriptions for krm_headword_chars are as follows:\nColumn Name English Explanation hanzi_id A sequential ID assigned to each Headword (whether single or multi-character) in the order of its appearance in the Myōgishō. It consists of a 5-digit numeric ID starting with \u0026lsquo;S\u0026rsquo;. entry_id The ID of the Entry (from krm_main) to which the Headword (containing this constituent character) belongs. This ID is a 5-digit numeric value starting with \u0026lsquo;F\u0026rsquo;. For some newly added Entries, a \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; suffix is appended. constituent_char The constituent Chinese character itself. Abbreviation marks (ー) and iteration marks (〻) are converted to the actual characters they represent. Collated Chinese characters are, in principle, Kangxi Dictionary forms; the handling of Unicode new character forms (common-use forms, popular variants) is specified separately. For detailed collation notes, refer to krm_notes (for Compiler's Remarks on collation). character_order Indicates the numerical order of appearance of the character within its Headword. kazama_location_id An ID indicating the location of this constituent character in the Kazama Edition: K + Volume (2 digits) + Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character Order in Segment (1 digit). tenri_location_id An ID indicating the location of this constituent character in the Tenri Edition: T + Volume (a/b/c) + Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character Order in Segment (1 digit). img_file_name File name of the image for the constituent Headword character (including the .jpg extension). The main part of the file name consists of a 7-digit number for images from Volume 1 to Volume 9, and an 8-digit number for images from Volume 10. For 7-digit numbers, the first digit indicates the volume number; for 8-digit numbers, the first two digits indicate Volume 10. The last 6 digits are based on the order of appearance, assigned according to a unique internal rule. Detailed documentation for this naming convention is not available as the work was completed over two decades ago. Null if no image is available.

The content of each is explained as follows:\nTextual Collation (校勘, kōkan): Involves presenting textual variants by comparing the Myōgishō text with the main texts of other manuscripts and with fragmentary textual evidence (逸文, itsubun), conducting comparative analyses, correcting scribal errors, and reconstructing the original text. Source Criticism (出典考証, shutten kōshō): Entails searching for original sources cited in the Myōgishō, analyzing citation methods, and clarifying distinctions between direct and indirect (second-hand) citations. Review of Previous Scholarship (研究史整理, kenkyūshi seiri): Summarizes and introduces the views and findings of previous scholars. Lexical Analysis (語釈, goshaku): Consists of philological analysis concerning semantic meanings, phonology, and orthography of words and characters. Additional Expositions (余説, yosetsu): These are the annotator\u0026rsquo;s (i.e., the database compiler\u0026rsquo;s) own detailed discussions and considerations based on the analysis of specific Entries or elements within them. Ideally, annotations should be concise and clear. However, as a preliminary step, it is necessary to gather as much relevant material as possible for a given annotation. Only after this preparatory stage is complete can the work of selecting and refining the collected materials begin.\nThe materials collected to date are recorded as Compiler's Remarks in the remarks column of the krm_notes file.\nIn this document, we will first classify the Entries of the Myōgishō by their Headwords and the various types of Original Glosses they contain, and then present the quantities for each category. Based on this, we will consider the priority for creating annotations for each type of Headword and each category of Original Gloss element, focusing our primary analytical efforts on Japanese Native Readings (wakun) and Phonetic Glosses. This will clarify the basic principles for annotation creation and the primary subjects of analysis.\nNext, we will provide and explain specific examples of scribal errors, omissions, and superfluous characters (衍字, enji). We will also describe how such information is recorded in the Compiler's Remarks and conduct a calculation of the number of Headword characters.\nFor Notes on Character Form (字体注, jitaichū), we will organize their types and descriptive formats. By clarifying the content and format of these original notes, we aim to minimize the need for extensive commentary on them within the Compiler's Remarks.\nRegarding Semantic Glosses in Chinese (義注, gichū), we will indicate their types and quantities, and introduce examples of such glosses that have been mistakenly identified as katakana.\nFor Japanese Native Readings (和訓, wakun), given the extensive body of previous research, we will provide a list of these studies and the abbreviations used for them in the Compiler's Remarks. This will serve as an introduction to the foundational materials for annotating wakun.\nFinally, using page 62 of the Butsujō (仏上) volume of the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō as a specific example of annotation practice, we will introduce the content of the Compiler's Remarks. This will demonstrate how subtle differences in Hanzi (Chinese character) glyph forms can be explained in the annotations through the use of GlyphWiki.\nBasic Principles and Analytical Focus for Annotation Creation Calculation of Headword Character Count Types and Descriptive Formats of Notes on Character Form Types and Problems in Deciphering Phonetic Glosses Types and Quantities of Semantic Glosses in Chinese Foundational Materials for Annotating Japanese Native Readings (wakun) Specific Examples of Annotation Practice "},{"id":19,"href":"/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-06-pronunciations/","title":"krm_pronunciations","section":"Overview of Published Data","content":" krm_pronunciations # Overview and file formats # The Phonetic Glosses in the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō (hereafter Myōgishō) include Fanqie spellings (反切), Similar sound notes (類音注, ruion-chū), and Kana glosses (仮名注, kana-chū).

Accordingly, as part of the HDIC project, we have decided to release data in accordance with the DHSJR specifications.\nThe DHSJR defines a data structure with 23 column names.\nTo facilitate linkage with the Myōgishō data included in HDIC, it is necessary for HDIC to assign unique column names to its own data files and to establish Primary Keys and Foreign Keys for interoperability between HDIC\u0026rsquo;s internal data files.\nFor this purpose, pronunciation_id (音注ID) has been set as the Primary Key, and definition_seq_id (注文ID) as the Foreign Key.\nSince the Myōgishō features diverse formats for its Phonetic Glosses, a classification field named annotation_format (音注型) has been established to categorize them.\nWhile DHSJR uses Japanese column names, HDIC employs English ones. Therefore, for data processing convenience within HDIC, English column names have been adopted.\nColumn name comparison # The current draft, with English and Japanese explanations side-by-side, is as follows.

For the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō, an additional hkrm- is appended, followed by an 8-digit number indicating its location information to form the GlyphWiki glyph name.\nRegarding the glyph , searching for \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; in the HNG (Hanzi Normative Glyphs Database) at https://search.hng-data.org/search confirms that an example exists in the Ueno manuscript of the Hanshu (Book of Han), specifically in the Yang Xiong (楊雄) section.\nWhen creating annotations related to Headwords, it may be necessary to create and display glyphs using GlyphWiki, or to create and display cropped images from the original manuscript.\nHowever, for text-based annotation creation, such visual representations can reduce readability. Therefore, using the IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence) method is often more practical. The aforementioned glyph can be represented, for example, as ⿰⿳艹口土見.\nExamining Phonetic Glosses # The Guangyun (広韻) # The character \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is listed in the Guangyun under the Departing tone (去声, qùshēng) and the Zhen rhyme (震韻). Its semantic gloss (義注, gichū) is given as \u0026ldquo;見也\u0026rdquo; (to see), and it belongs to the xiaoyun (小韻, phonetic group) \u0026lsquo;僅\u0026rsquo;, which is indicated by the fanqie spelling \u0026ldquo;渠遴切\u0026rdquo; (qú lìn qiè).\nTaking \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; as an example, there are two primary ways to present this information in an annotation:\nIndicating only the phonetic information: \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is given in the Guangyun as \u0026ldquo;渠遴切\u0026rdquo; (qú lìn qiè; Departing tone, Zhen rhyme (震韻), under xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;僅\u0026rsquo;). Indicating both phonetic and semantic information: \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is given in the Guangyun as \u0026ldquo;見也\u0026rdquo; (to see; Departing tone, Zhen rhyme (震韻), under xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;僅\u0026rsquo;: \u0026ldquo;渠遴切\u0026rdquo; qú lìn qiè). Standard Pronunciation (Seion) # The first Phonetic Gloss in the Kanchi-in manuscript entry for \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is a homophone gloss (同音字注, dōonji-chū) given as \u0026ldquo;音僅（R）\u0026rdquo;. This corresponds to the xiaoyun character \u0026lsquo;僅\u0026rsquo; from the Guangyun\u0026rsquo;s Departing tone, Zhen rhyme (震韻). The \u0026lsquo;R\u0026rsquo; is the symbol indicating the Departing tone, so the tone also matches.\nWhile Kan-on (漢音, Han pronunciations) are also referred to as Seion (正音, standard pronunciations), their tones often align with those in the Guangyun. The Kanchi-in manuscript\u0026rsquo;s entry for \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; also matches the Guangyun tone.\nTherefore, for annotation purposes, it would likely be sufficient to indicate only the phonetic information, such as: \u0026ldquo;\u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is given in the Guangyun as \u0026ldquo;渠遴切\u0026rdquo; (qú lìn qiè; Departing tone, Zhen rhyme (震韻), under xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;僅\u0026rsquo;).\u0026rdquo;\nIt should be noted that the character \u0026lsquo;音\u0026rsquo; (sound/pronunciation) in the original manuscript often appears as the abbreviated character \u0026lsquo;亠\u0026rsquo;, but our policy is to normalize it to the standard form \u0026lsquo;音\u0026rsquo; in transcriptions.\nJapanese-adapted Pronunciation (Wa-on) # Another Phonetic Gloss provided is \u0026ldquo;和後ン（_L）\u0026rdquo;, indicating that the Wa-on (和音, Japanese-adapted pronunciation) is \u0026ldquo;後ン\u0026rdquo; with a low, level tone pattern (_L). The \u0026lsquo;和\u0026rsquo; (for Wa-on) in the original manuscript often appears as the abbreviated character \u0026lsquo;禾\u0026rsquo;, but this too is normalized to the standard form \u0026lsquo;和\u0026rsquo; in transcriptions.\nThe \u0026lsquo;後\u0026rsquo; in \u0026ldquo;後ン\u0026rdquo; is understood to represent the voiced sound go. The Tone Mark (shōten) is applied only to \u0026lsquo;ン\u0026rsquo; as a level tone (平声, pingshēng). In the Guangyun, \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is a Departing tone character, and the Departing tone is considered to be a rising or high falling tone. Although the tone of \u0026lsquo;後\u0026rsquo; in the Kanchi-in manuscript\u0026rsquo;s Wa-on reading is unclear, \u0026lsquo;ン\u0026rsquo; is marked with a level tone, making it difficult to interpret as a rising or high falling tone. It was likely a low, level tone. From these points, it is evident that the tonal pronunciations differ between the Seion and the Wa-on.\nThe textual sources for Wa-on readings are believed to reflect the pronunciations used when reciting sutras such as the Lotus Sutra (法華経, Hokekyō) and the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra (大般若経, Dai-Hannya-kyō). Checking with the SAT Taishō Tripiṭaka Text Database (大正新脩大蔵経データベース), \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; appears multiple times in both the Lotus Sutra and the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra.\nExamining the Zushoryōbon manuscript of the original compilation of the Ruiju Myōgishō, we find citations from Shingō\u0026rsquo;s Dai-Hannya-kyō Onkun (大般若経音訓, Phonetic Readings and Meanings of the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra) and Fujiwara no Kintō\u0026rsquo;s Dai-Hannya-kyō Jishō (大般若経字抄, Character Excerpts from the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra). While the Dai-Hannya-kyō Onkun is a lost work (逸書, issho), the Ishiyama-dera manuscript of the Dai-Hannya-kyō Jishō is extant and can be collated. Upon investigation, \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; does not appear in the Dai-Hannya-kyō Jishō.\nFor annotation purposes, it is necessary to note any questions regarding the character forms of Hanzi (Chinese characters) or kana, and the placement of Tone Marks (shōten). The distinction between red and black ink for these marks, as well as the condition of any manuscript damage (e.g., wormholes), should be recorded as needed. Furthermore, one might note the presence or absence of the character in the Lotus Sutra and the Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, record relevant content from the Ishiyama-dera manuscript of the Dai-Hannya-kyō Jishō or from extant fragments of the Dai-Hannya-kyō Onkun, and add critical analysis (考証, kōshō).\nExamining Japanese Native Readings (wakun) # Two Japanese Native Readings (wakun) are provided for \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo;: \u0026ldquo;ミル\u0026rdquo; (miru; LH) and \u0026ldquo;マミユ\u0026rdquo; (mamiyu; HLH).\nThe character \u0026lsquo;覲\u0026rsquo; is explained in the Shuowen Jiezi (説文解字), under the \u0026ldquo;見\u0026rdquo; (see) radical section, as: \u0026ldquo;諸侯秋朝曰覲，勞王事。从見堇聲\u0026rdquo; (When feudal lords have an audience with the sovereign in autumn, it is called jìn (覲); they are exerting themselves in the king\u0026rsquo;s affairs. The character is composed of the radical 見 and takes its sound from 堇). This corresponds to the wakun \u0026ldquo;ミル\u0026rdquo; (miru) in the sense of \u0026ldquo;to have an audience with,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to be granted an audience.\u0026rdquo;\nA relevant passage can be found in the Zhouli (周禮; Rites of Zhou), in the \u0026ldquo;Spring Offices - Great Minister of Rites\u0026rdquo; (春官・大宗伯, Chūnguān Dàzōngbó) section: \u0026ldquo;春見曰朝、夏見曰宗、秋見曰覲、冬見曰遇、時見曰會、殷見曰同。\u0026rdquo; (An audience in spring is called cháo; in summer, zōng; in autumn, jìn (覲); in winter, yù; an audience at any time, huì; and an audience with various lords together, tóng.)\nCreating Annotations # Ideally, annotations would be created to cover all the types of content discussed above. However, conducting critical investigations for approximately 32,600 Entries and about 86,800 Original Gloss elements—totaling around 119,400 items—would require an immense amount of time and effort.\nThe areas where research has been most extensively accumulated are, firstly, Japanese Native Readings (wakun), and secondly, Phonetic Glosses. Research concerning Notes on Character Form and Semantic Glosses in Chinese is less abundant. Therefore, we will begin by incorporating the research findings of previous scholars concerning Japanese Native Readings (wakun).\nAnnotating Japanese Native Readings (wakun) # There are many scholarly works that discuss Japanese Native Readings (wakun) to which Tone Marks (shōten) have been applied. Furthermore, not a few wakun have identifiable sources, such as those found in Monzen (文選) readings.\nThe following publications are essential references for determining the lexical forms of Japanese Native Readings (wakun). As they are frequently used in creating annotations, they will be referred to by the abbreviations shown below:\nMasamune\u0026rsquo;s Index (正宗索引, Masamune Sakuin): Masamune Atsuo, ed.

Beijing: Shangwu Yinshuguan (商務印書館), 2003. The copy I have in my possession is the two-volume edition published in 2007. It is a compilation of glosses found in 250 texts from the Pre-Qin period to the late Qing dynasty. Prior to this, Ruan Yuan\u0026rsquo;s (阮元) Jingji Zuan Gu (經籍纂詁) was the standard rhyme-arranged lexicographical tool for ancient glosses. The Guxun Huizuan is arranged by radical and stroke count, and it includes a significantly larger number of source texts.\nAnnotating Phonetic Glosses # For Phonetic Glosses, the primary necessity is to collate them with the Guangyun (広韻). Using this as a foundation, analyses will be conducted on Tone Marks (shōten), Kana glosses (仮名音注, kana-onchū), Wa-on notes (和音注, wa-on chū), and Go-on notes (呉音注, go-on chū). Since many Headwords are not found in the Guangyun, it is also necessary to refer to descriptions in texts such as the Tenrei Banshō Meigi (篆隷万象名義), extant fragments of the original Yupian (原本玉篇残巻, genpon Gyokuhen zankan), the Song edition of the Yupian (宋本玉篇, Sōhon Gyokuhen), the Longkan Shoujian (龍龕手鑑, Ryūgan Shukan), and the Yiqiejing Yinyi (一切経音義).\nVarious facsimile editions and indexes of these works are available. Additionally, many dictionaries and rhyme books can now be searched online.\nThe following are a list of resources primarily from my personal collection that I have utilized to date.

Following this discussion, it will proceed to calculate the keishutsuji-sū (掲出字数). The keishutsuji-sū refers to the total number of characters that constitute all Headwords.\nThen, based on the results of this keishutsuji-sū calculation, the number of Entries (keishutsu kōmoku-sū, 掲出項目数) will also be calculated. The number of Entries will be aggregated according to the number of characters constituting their Headwords (e.g., Entries with single-character Headwords, Entries with two-character Headwords, and so on).\nFinally, a list will be provided showing the keishutsuji-sū (total headword character count) and the number of Entries (keishutsu kōmoku-sū) for each of the 120 radical sections of the Myōgishō. In this listing, our calculated number of Entries will be compared with the entry count calculated by Sakai Kenji, and any discrepancies between our calculations and his will also be explained.\nMiswritten Characters (goji) # Below are some examples of Miswritten Characters (誤字, goji) found in Headwords.\nThe examples are presented by extracting relevant portions from krm_main.tsv and adding the content of the remarks column from krm_notes.tsv. For ease of reference, the Kazama Edition location is also shown as kazama_location. For instance, K02008840 indicates an appearance in Volume 2 (仏中, Butsuchū), Page 8, Line 8, Segment 4 (the explanation for the last digit, which represents character order within the segment, is omitted here).\nThe first example is relatively straightforward.\nExample:\nkazama_location: K02008840 hanzi_entry: 姡 original_entry: 活 definition: 今 remarks: The Headword is a scribal error. It has been corrected to \u0026lsquo;姡\u0026rsquo; based on the Kōzan-ji, Renshō-in, and Sainen-ji manuscripts, all of which have \u0026lsquo;姡\u0026rsquo;. This example is a Headword from the \u0026ldquo;女\u0026rdquo; (woman) radical section. Since other manuscripts (異本, ihon) have the character \u0026lsquo;姡\u0026rsquo; (with the \u0026ldquo;女\u0026rdquo; woman radical), it is clear that there is a scribal error in the Kanchi-in manuscript.\nThe following is an example where it is difficult to determine whether the Headword is a Miswritten Character.\nExample:\nkazama_location: K01045610 hanzi_entry: 迷 original_entry: 〇 definition: 俗悉字　私逸反 remarks: Is the Headword \u0026lsquo;迷\u0026rsquo; a glyph form that evolved from \u0026lsquo;⿺辶半\u0026rsquo;, a variant character (itaiji) of \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo;? In this example, the Headword \u0026lsquo;迷\u0026rsquo; has the Note on Character Form \u0026ldquo;俗悉字\u0026rdquo; (zoku Shitsu ji; \u0026ldquo;popular form of 悉\u0026rdquo;) in its Original Glosses, indicating it is treated as a \u0026lsquo;popular\u0026rsquo; form of \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo;. However, \u0026lsquo;迷\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo; are distinct characters, and to connect them, a scribal error must be assumed. It is presumed that this form arose from writing the \u0026lsquo;心\u0026rsquo; (heart) component at the bottom of \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo; in a way that resembles \u0026lsquo;辶\u0026rsquo; (motion radical). This is an example where a variant character (itaiji) of \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo; appears to have been conflated with, or graphically evolved towards, the character \u0026lsquo;迷\u0026rsquo;.\nThe hypothesized process of change from \u0026lsquo;悉\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;迷\u0026rsquo; can be illustrated as follows:\n→ → → → According to GlyphWiki, an example of (𨒃, U+28483) can be found in [Yínánzì Kǎoshì Yǔ Yánjiū (疑難字考釋與研究, Philological Studies and Research on Difficult and Problematic Characters)].\nOmitted Characters (脱字, datsuji) # Omitted Characters (datsuji) in Headwords, which have been detailed elsewhere, are handled as follows: when a character is clearly omitted from a Headword, the presumed omitted character is indicated by enclosing it in full-width square brackets \u0026ldquo;［］\u0026rdquo;.\nExample:\n是／［以］ 不／奈／［何］ 将／為／［便］ 嘻／［囉］ 奢／［侈］ 奚／［如］ An example of the corresponding annotation is shown below:\nExample:\nkazama_location: K0200663 hanzi_entry: 奚／［如］ original_entry: 〇／〇 definition: イカム（__L remarks: The character \u0026lsquo;如\u0026rsquo; is omitted. The Renjō-in manuscript has \u0026lsquo;奚如\u0026rsquo;. The Kōzan-ji manuscript does not use the substitution mark \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; but explicitly writes \u0026lsquo;如\u0026rsquo;, and this entry is located near the latter half of the \u0026ldquo;女\u0026rdquo; (woman) radical section. This Kōzan-ji manuscript usage is considered to be an earlier example (Okada\u0026rsquo;s research, p. 192). Superfluous Characters # Superfluous Characters (enji) # Instances of Superfluous Characters (enji) in Headwords are rarely found.\nExample:\nkazama_location: K0402481, hanzi_entry: ⿱赤廾, definition: サカユ　シツカナリ kazama_location: K0402482, hanzi_entry: 人, definition: （無） (Unannotated), remarks: Could this \u0026lsquo;人\u0026rsquo; be a superfluous character? Alternatively, the Headword might be a variant of \u0026lsquo;奕\u0026rsquo;, and this \u0026lsquo;人\u0026rsquo; a miscopied iteration mark for the compound \u0026lsquo;奕奕\u0026rsquo;. The compound \u0026lsquo;奕奕\u0026rsquo; has examples in the Shijing (Book of Odes). The reason for the presence of the character \u0026lsquo;人\u0026rsquo; in the second entry is unclear, and it is suspected to be a superfluous character.\nEmbedded Characters (umeji) and the Bunchūshiki (Divided-Annotation Style) # Embedded Characters (umeji) refer to Entry-like segments that are incorporated within another main Entry.\nExample:\nkazama_location: K0201261 hanzi_entry: 娜 definition (representing Original Glosses): 乃可（H）反　マヽハヽ　タヲヤカナリ　婀ー　ヨキカホ　ナマメク remarks (Compiler's Remark): Could the segment \u0026ldquo;婀ー　ヨキカホ　ナマメク\u0026rdquo; be an embedded item/entry? These embedded segments can either be considered equivalent to a separate Entry or interpreted as an explanation of a compound word provided within the Original Glosses of the main Entry.\nThe method of embedding glosses for a multi-character compound within the Original Glosses of a single (often the first) character of that compound is termed the \u0026ldquo;Divided-Annotation Style\u0026rdquo; (分註式, Bunchūshiki). In contrast, the method of presenting such information as an independent Entry following the main single-character Entry is called the \u0026ldquo;Independent-Entry Style\u0026rdquo; (独立式, Dokuritsushiki) (Okada Yoshio, Ruiju Myōgishō no Kenkyū [A Study of the Ruiju Myōgishō], p. 313 ff.).\nWhile these annotation styles are important indicators for studying the relationships between different manuscripts and the sequential ordering of Entries, they will not be discussed further in this section.\nSubstitution Marks (代用符号, daiyō fugō) using \u0026lsquo;｜\u0026rsquo; (transcribed as \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo;) # When the same Headword as in the preceding Entry is used, the vertical line \u0026lsquo;丨\u0026rsquo; (U+4E28) is sometimes employed in the original manuscript to substitute for it. In this database, for better readability in horizontal text, this \u0026lsquo;丨\u0026rsquo; is represented by \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (CHOONPU - long vowel mark, U+30FC), followed by the actual Headword it represents, enclosed in parentheses.\nWhile the Substitution Mark \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; (representing the original \u0026lsquo;丨\u0026rsquo;) almost always refers to the Headword of the immediately preceding Entry, users should be aware that in very rare cases, it may refer to the Headword of an Entry that is not directly adjacent, skipping over one or more intervening Entries.\nThe following example illustrates a case where \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; refers to a Headword that is considerably distant.\nExample:\nkazama_location: K01038411, hanzi_entry: 以／後, definition: ノチ kazama_location: K01038420, hanzi_entry: 㣭, definition: 字公（L）反　數也 kazama_location: K01038430, hanzi_entry: 𢓈, definition: 音旬之去声　トヽム　メクル　アマネシ kazama_location: K01038510, hanzi_entry: 徇, definition: 同　トナフ　*アハネシ（L___）　シタカフ（_HV）　*イトナム kazama_location: K01038530, hanzi_entry: 彴, definition: 止「已」約反　シタフ kazama_location: K01038541, hanzi_entry: 已／ー, definition: 同 kazama_location: K01038611, hanzi_entry: 向／ー, definition: ユクサキ（HH__）　ユクスヱ, remarks: Erroneous Headword; should be \u0026lsquo;向後\u0026rsquo;. Okada\u0026rsquo;s research (pp. 193-194) notes that the use of \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; is appropriate for the Kōzan-ji manuscript. Regarding the last two Headwords in the example (\u0026lsquo;已／ー\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;向／ー\u0026rsquo;), if one were to straightforwardly interpret the substitution mark \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; as referring to the immediately preceding Headword (\u0026lsquo;彴\u0026rsquo; from K01038530), they would become \u0026lsquo;已／ー (substituting 彴)\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;向／ー (substituting 彴)\u0026rsquo;. However, this interpretation does not make sense in context. As Okada Yoshio has pointed out, the Headword \u0026lsquo;向／ー\u0026rsquo; in this section should actually be \u0026lsquo;向後\u0026rsquo;. Consequently, the preceding Headword \u0026lsquo;已／ー\u0026rsquo; should then be interpreted as \u0026lsquo;已／後\u0026rsquo;.\nIn other words, it is hypothesized that this section originally had the Entries with Headwords \u0026lsquo;以／後\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;已／後\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;向／後\u0026rsquo; listed in sequence. Subsequently, the Entries listed above from the second one (K01038420, Headword \u0026lsquo;㣭\u0026rsquo;) through the fifth one (K01038530, Headword \u0026lsquo;彴\u0026rsquo;) are presumed to have been inserted into this original sequence.\nIteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji) using \u0026lsquo;〻\u0026rsquo; # Iteration Marks (踊り字, odoriji) are also known as repetition marks (繰り返し符号, kurikaeshi fugō) or similar terms. Although the iteration mark \u0026lsquo;々\u0026rsquo; (U+3005) is commonly used for Hanzi (Chinese characters) today, this database employs \u0026lsquo;〻\u0026rsquo; (U+303B). In the Kanchi-in manuscript, the \u0026lsquo;〻\u0026rsquo; mark is typically used for the second and subsequent characters in the Headword of an Entry for a compound word (熟語項目, jukugo kōmoku), as shown in the examples below.\nExamples:\nkazama_location: K01059441, hanzi_entry: ー（迢）／〻（迢）, definition: トホノカナリ kazama_location: K02021731, hanzi_entry: 曽／ー（祖）／〻（母）, definition: オホオハ（LHLHV） kazama_location: K06036711, hanzi_entry: 郁／〻（郁）, definition: マタラカナリ（LLVHL__） Characters in Original Glosses Written in Large Size # There are instances where characters within the Original Glosses are written in a large size, similar to Headwords, which can lead to confusion.\nExample 1:\nkazama_location: K02051210 hanzi_entry: 𠰍 definition: 音主　呼鷄 remarks (Compiler's Remark): In both the Kōzan-ji and Renjō-in manuscripts, the part corresponding to \u0026lsquo;呼鷄\u0026rsquo; is rendered as \u0026lsquo;ー〻呼鷄\u0026rsquo; (where \u0026lsquo;ー〻\u0026rsquo; likely indicates iteration or continuation from a preceding entry, followed by \u0026lsquo;呼鷄\u0026rsquo;). The Kanchi-in manuscript, however, writes \u0026lsquo;呼鷄\u0026rsquo; in a large size. This is an example from the \u0026ldquo;口\u0026rdquo; (mouth) radical section. While the Kanchi-in manuscript writes \u0026lsquo;呼鷄\u0026rsquo; in a large size, both the Kōzan-ji and Renjō-in manuscripts have \u0026lsquo;ー〻呼鷄\u0026rsquo;, suggesting that \u0026lsquo;呼鷄\u0026rsquo; in the Kanchi-in manuscript should be considered as characters within the Original Glosses (rather than a separate Headword).\nExample 2:\nkazama_location: K06100620 hanzi_entry: 憙 definition: 音喜（H-L）　又嬉　コノム（LLH）　喜「注也」　ネカフ　ツクス　ヨロコフ（LLH_）　ヒロシ（LL_） remarks (Compiler's Remark): Within the Original Glosses, the character \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo; is written in a large size; \u0026lsquo;注也\u0026rsquo; (\u0026ldquo;this is a gloss\u0026rdquo;) is written to its left in red ink. This example is from the \u0026ldquo;心\u0026rdquo; (heart) radical section. Here, the character \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo; is written in a large size, making it appear like a Headword. However, the annotation \u0026lsquo;注也\u0026rsquo; (chū nari; \u0026ldquo;this is a gloss\u0026rdquo;) to its left explicitly indicates that \u0026lsquo;喜\u0026rsquo; is a character within the Original Glosses and not a Headword.\nNumber of Entries # Number of Entries and Total Headword Character Count # The number of Entries in the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō was published in: Ikeda Shoju, Liu Guanwei, Jun Munho, Zhang Xinfang, and Li Yuan, “Full-text Database of Ruiju Myōgishō, Kanchi-in MS : A Look at Development Methods and Calculating the Number of Headwords.” (Kuntengo to Kuten Shiryō 144, 2020). This paper classifies Entries by the number of characters in their Headwords and provides a detailed breakdown of these counts.\nFor example, a table row such as:\nNo. Radical1 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 001 人 (Man) 616 203 26 5 2 3 855 1,149 indicates that in the \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; (man) radical section (人部, jinbu), there are 616 Entries whose Headwords are in Single Character Form (1 character). Headwords with two or more characters are in Multi-Character Form; in this section, there are 203 Entries with two-character Headwords, 26 with three-character, 5 with four-character, 2 with five-character, and 3 with six-or-more-character Headwords. The total number of Entries for this radical section is 855. The breakdown for the \u0026ldquo;6+ char\u0026rdquo; (6字以上) category is: 2 Entries with six-character Headwords and 1 Entry with a seven-character Headword. Therefore, the total number of characters (jisū, 字数; i.e., the sum of characters in all Headwords for this section) is calculated as 1,149 using the following formula:\n616 (representing 616 x 1) + (203 x 2) + (26 x 3) + (5 x 4) + (2 x 5) + (2 x 6) + (1 x 7) = 1,149 Verification of Entry Counts # The verification of Entry counts was primarily focused on radical sections where discrepancies were found with the figures presented in Sakai Kenji\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Ruiju Myōgishō no Jijun to Bushu Hairetsu\u0026rdquo; (Character Order and Radical Arrangement in the Ruiju Myōgishō), published in Honpō Jishoshi Ronsō (Collected Papers on the History of Dictionaries in Japan), edited by Yamada Tadao (Tokyo: Sanseidō, 1967), pp. 191–258.\nAs a result, discrepancies were identified in the following 25 radical sections. The \u0026ldquo;Difference\u0026rdquo; column indicates cases where the count in Ikeda et al. (2020) is less than that in Sakai (1967) with a negative number (e.g., -1), and where it is greater with a positive number (e.g., +1). Counts determined to be correct as a result of this verification are shown in bold. Sections shown with non-bolded figures signify that, even if the counts from the two sources differ, a conclusion was pending or not reached in the current verification.\nNo. Radical Sakai (1967) Ikeda et al.

(from initial) 028 手 (Hand) 1,148 1,149 +1 086 毛 (Fur) 104 103 -1 Many of these discrepancies relate to differences in how Entries are identified and counted. Therefore, the following sections will specifically explain the discrepancies with the Entry counts presented in Sakai (1967). Finally, a list of Entry counts for each radical section, based on the revised figures, will be provided.\nButsujō (仏上 – First \u0026ldquo;Buddha\u0026rdquo; Fascicle) # In the Butsujō (仏上) section, discrepancies in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020) are found for the following two radical sections. The figures presented in the table below are from Ikeda et al. (2020):\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 001 人 (Man) 616 203 26 5 2 3 855 1,149 003 辵 (Walk) 368 81 10 2 0 1 462 575 For the \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; (Man) radical section (人部, jinbu), the following instance, which should have been counted as two separate Entries, was mistakenly counted as a single Entry:\nkazama_location: K01008341, hanzi_entry: 於／ー（何）, definition: 同 kazama_location: K01008343, hanzi_entry: 奈／ー（何）, definition: 同 This can be confirmed on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nIn addition to this, there are the following four Entries where Omitted Characters in the Headword were supplied:\nkazama_location: K01005131, hanzi_entry: 是／［以］ kazama_location: K01008421, hanzi_entry: 不／奈／［何］ kazama_location: K01031111, hanzi_entry: 将／為／［便］ kazama_location: K01035310, hanzi_entry: 奢／［侈］ The figures for the \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; (Man) radical section in Ikeda et al. (2020) need to be corrected for the number of Entries as follows. The corrected figures are shown in bold:\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 001 人 (Man) 614 205 28 4 2 3 856 1,153 For the \u0026ldquo;辵\u0026rdquo; (Walk) radical section (辵部, Chaku-bu), the following two Entries appear consecutively. Although they might seem like a single Entry, \u0026lsquo;迁\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;還\u0026rsquo; are distinct characters.\nkazama_location: K01050412, hanzi_entry: 迁 kazama_location: K01050420, hanzi_entry: 還, definition: 音環(L)　カヘル-ス　メクル　マクラス　シリソク　マタ　ヤム　又音旋　和外ン This is a section where \u0026lsquo;迂\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;迃\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;迁\u0026rsquo; appear in sequence, and it is considered to be an arrangement where Headwords with similar glyph forms are listed consecutively. The Entry for \u0026lsquo;迁\u0026rsquo; is treated as an unannotated Entry.\nThis can be confirmed on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nThe discrepancy in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020) is presumed to be due to differences in the method of counting this particular instance.\nButsuchū (仏中 – Middle \u0026ldquo;Buddha\u0026rdquo; Fascicle) # In the Butsuchū section, discrepancies in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al.

The Entry for \u0026lsquo;⿰口⿰木㬅\u0026rsquo; is likely an unannotated one.\nPlease refer to the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nThe following is an example that could be interpreted as either one Entry or two, depending on the criteria for identification:\nkazama_location: K02030211, hanzi_entry: 呴／吽／𤘘, definition: ◉呴吽𤘘「クチサキラ（HHHVHL）」　「或本ニハ已上五字カキツヽケタリ」 (In another manuscript, the preceding five characters are written consecutively) kazama_location: K02030221, hanzi_entry: 吼／㖃, definition: 五正　呼厚反　イヒキ　ヨハフ　ホユ（LH）　ナク（HL）　和ク（L） The Entry for \u0026lsquo;呴／吽／𤘘\u0026rsquo; has the note \u0026ldquo;或本ニハ已上五字カキツヽケタリ\u0026rdquo; (In another manuscript, the preceding five characters are written consecutively). At first glance, this makes it seem separate from the following Entry for \u0026lsquo;吼／㖃\u0026rsquo;. However, it could also be considered as a single, continuous Entry.\nIn Ikeda et al.

The Headword of the second Entry (K03012520, with hanzi_entry: 𧥑) is the glyph . These three glyphs appear consecutively in the manuscript. A slight space is observed between the first glyph and the second glyph (both part of K0301251\u0026rsquo;s Headword). A clear space, equivalent to one character width, is found between the second glyph (the end of K03012511\u0026rsquo;s Headword) and the third glyph (the Headword of K03012520).

In Ikeda et al. (2020), this sequence was counted as two Entries. This determination was based on the clear space between the second glyph (the last character of the first Entry\u0026rsquo;s Headword) and the third glyph (the Headword of the second Entry), and the fact that the first Entry (K0301251, \u0026lsquo;⿳或或角／𧥑\u0026rsquo;) is unannotated.\nPlease refer to the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nIncidentally, this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript of the Myōgishō bears a strong resemblance to Entries found in Volume 4 of the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing (龍龕手鏡), under the \u0026ldquo;角\u0026rdquo; (horn) radical.\nlocation: Lb1690102, hanzi_entry: ⿳或旦角／⿳或或角, definition: 二俗。 (Two popular forms.) location: Lb1690104, hanzi_entry: ⿳咸咸角／𧥑, definition: 二古。 (Two old forms.) location: Lb1690106, hanzi_entry: 觱, definition: 今。音必。羗人吹角以驚与也。今作篳ー篥樂噐也。下又音佛。ー理也。五。 (Current form.

However, the blank space following \u0026lsquo;焭\u0026rsquo; (K04041732) is distinct. Considering this, and given that there are instances where a Form Classification Tag can refer to a preceding Entry, Ikeda et al. (2020) counted \u0026lsquo;焭\u0026rsquo; (K04041732) as a separate, unannotated Entry.\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nkazama_location: K04052540, hanzi_entry: ⿱亦火, definition: 餘石反　盛也　カヽヤク　⿱赤火　ウレフ　ユク　和ヤク, remarks (Compiler's Remark): The string \u0026lsquo;⿱赤火\u0026rsquo; can be interpreted as either an Embedded Item (umeji) or as a note on a variant character (itaiji). This case is as explained in the remarks column. The string \u0026lsquo;⿱赤火\u0026rsquo; is written in a slightly larger size, and if considered an Embedded Item, it would increase the Entry count by one. However, since Masamune\u0026rsquo;s Kanji Index (正宗漢字索引, Masamune Kanji Sakuin) does not list \u0026lsquo;⿱赤火\u0026rsquo; as a separate Headword, it was treated as an annotation concerning a variant character (itaiji) within the Original Glosses.\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nHōjō (法上 – First “Dharma” Fascicle) # For the \u0026ldquo;水\u0026rdquo; (Water) radical section (水部, Sui-bu), attention should be paid to the following four Entries, which are associated with the note \u0026ldquo;此クタリ二水ノトコロニアリ\u0026rdquo; (These items are in the place of 冫 [nisui, the ice radical]):\nkazama_location: K05033810, hanzi_entry: ■, definition: 「此クタリ二水ノトコロニアリ」　フチ(LH) (Compiler\u0026rsquo;s Note for K0503381: An Interpolation Mark appears immediately before this.

(2020) calculated 1,321 Entries, resulting in a difference of one Entry. Upon review, the following Entry is a potential source of this counting discrepancy:\nkazama_location: K05001310, hanzi_entry: 水, definition (representing Original Glosses): 尸癸反　ミツ（HHV）　カハ　月ー（水）　ツキノサハリ　和スイ（LH） The string \u0026lsquo;月ー（水）\u0026rsquo; (moon-[substituting for] water; referring to menstruation, 月水 gessui) is a compound word. If this were treated as an Embedded Item (umeji) and counted as a separate Entry, the Entry counts of Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020) for this radical section would become identical. However, the subsequent part of the Original Glosses, \u0026ldquo;和スイ（LH）\u0026rdquo; (a Wa-on pronunciation for \u0026lsquo;水\u0026rsquo;), pertains to the main Headword \u0026lsquo;水\u0026rsquo;. Identifying an embedded Entry in a way that interrupts the glosses for the main Headword is problematic. Therefore, this Entry (for \u0026lsquo;水\u0026rsquo;) is maintained as a single Entry as per Ikeda et al. (2020).\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;足\u0026rdquo; (Foot) radical section (足部, Sokubu), Sakai (1967) counts 494 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 493 Entries, a difference of one Entry. The following instance is likely related to this discrepancy:\nkazama_location: K05076311, hanzi_entry: 踟／ー（蹰）, definition (representing Original Glosses): 上馳(L)　又智音　或躊字　タチヤスラフ　オソシ, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: \u0026ldquo;躊字\u0026rdquo; (the characters \u0026lsquo;躊\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;字\u0026rsquo;) is written in a large size. It is considered part of the Original Glosses. As noted in the remarks (the Compiler's Remark), one might consider counting \u0026ldquo;躊字\u0026rdquo; (the characters \u0026lsquo;躊\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;字\u0026rsquo; found in the gloss above) as a separate Entry. However, the character \u0026lsquo;躊\u0026rsquo; is itself listed as the Headword of the very next Entry:\nkazama_location: K05076330, hanzi_entry: 躊, definition (representing Original Glosses): 音儔　タチモトホル　タチヤスラフ（LH____） Therefore, rather than considering \u0026lsquo;躊\u0026rsquo; to be a duplicated Headword (or \u0026ldquo;躊字\u0026rdquo; to be an independent embedded Entry), it is considered more appropriate to interpret \u0026ldquo;躊字\u0026rdquo; in the first instance as characters within the Original Glosses that were simply written in a large size.\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nHōchū (法中 – Middle \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; Fascicle) # In the Hōchū section, discrepancies in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al.

(2020) initially counted 376 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is likely related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K06001320, hanzi_entry: ⿸𠂋帀, definition (representing Original Glosses): 古　△在下 In the Original Gloss \u0026ldquo;△在下\u0026rdquo;, the \u0026lsquo;△\u0026rsquo; symbol is written in a slightly larger size, which was misidentified as a separate Headword (contributing to the initial count of 376 by Ikeda et al.).\nAdditionally, an Entry where an Omitted Character in the Headword was supplied is the following:\nkazama_location: K06012741, hanzi_entry: 桃／花／［石］, definition: 此間音タウクヱシヤク（LHHHLLL） The Entry count and total headword character count for the \u0026ldquo;石\u0026rdquo; (Stone) radical section are corrected as follows:\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 051 石 (Stone) 307 56 6 3 0 4 375 472 For the \u0026ldquo;玉\u0026rdquo; (Jade) radical section (玉部, Gyokubu), Sakai (1967) counts 384 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 383 Entries, a difference of one Entry. The following Entry is likely related to this discrepancy:\nkazama_location: K06013430, hanzi_entry: 玊, definition (representing Original Glosses): 音夙（T）「シク」　又栗（T）「リク」　又欣救反　琢「ミカク」玉を工也, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: \u0026lsquo;栗\u0026rsquo; is an error for \u0026lsquo;粟\u0026rsquo;. The red ink mark on \u0026lsquo;玉\u0026rsquo; might be an Morphosyntactic Glosses (wokototen, ヲコト点) for \u0026lsquo;を\u0026rsquo; (wo). \u0026lsquo;工也\u0026rsquo; is written in small characters in the manuscript, but it has been transcribed in large characters here because the Guangyun has the semantic gloss \u0026lsquo;琢玉工\u0026rsquo; (jade-carving artisan). There is a possibility of treating \u0026lsquo;琢玉\u0026rsquo; (jade carving), which appears in the gloss as \u0026lsquo;琢「ミカク」玉を\u0026rsquo;, as an Embedded Item (umeji). However, since \u0026lsquo;琢\u0026rsquo; is listed as a separate Headword elsewhere, it is likely appropriate to consider \u0026lsquo;琢玉\u0026rsquo; as part of the Original Glosses for \u0026lsquo;玊\u0026rsquo;.\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;心\u0026rdquo; (Heart) radical section (心部, Shinbu), Sakai (1967) counts 909 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 908 Entries, a difference of one Entry. The following Entry is likely related to this discrepancy:\nkazama_location: K06084521, hanzi_entry: 㥶, definition (representing Original Glosses): 「注」⿺⻎偘古　「注」⿱保言𠐨〈籀〉, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: Although \u0026lsquo;⿺⻎偘古\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;⿱保言𠐨\u0026rsquo; are written in large characters, each is accompanied by the character \u0026lsquo;注\u0026rsquo; (annotation), indicating they are part of the Original Glosses. Since \u0026lsquo;⿺⻎偘古\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;⿱保言𠐨\u0026rsquo; are written in large characters, there is a possibility of counting them as Headwords. However, they are not characters that would typically be assigned to the \u0026ldquo;心\u0026rdquo; (Heart) radical section, and furthermore, they are explicitly marked with \u0026lsquo;注\u0026rsquo; (annotation). Therefore, it is unlikely that Ikeda et al. (2020) miscounted by including these as separate Entries (implying the discrepancy may originate from Sakai\u0026rsquo;s count or another unclarified instance).\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;糸\u0026rdquo; (Silk) radical section (糸部, Shibu), there is no difference in the number of Entries between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al.

However, a correction is made to the character count of the Headword in the following Entry:\nkazama_location: K06121611, hanzi_entry: 罘／䋄, definition: ノアミ This corrects a previous misidentification where the Headword was mistakenly interpreted as \u0026lsquo;四／不／䋄\u0026rsquo;. As a result of this correction to the headword\u0026rsquo;s character composition, the breakdown of Entry counts by headword length and the total headword character count for this section are as follows (the total number of Entries, 736, remains unchanged):\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 059 糸 (Silk) 631 94 8 3 0 0 736 855 Hōge (法下 – Lower \u0026ldquo;Dharma\u0026rdquo; Fascicle) # In the Hōge, discrepancies in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020) are found for the following four radical sections. The figures presented in the table below are from Ikeda et al. (2020):\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 066 勹 29 4 0 0 0 0 33 37 068 雨 177 43 6 1 1 0 228 290 075 疒 234 138 23 1 1 2 399 603 080 寸 18 21 0 0 0 0 39 60 For the \u0026ldquo;勹\u0026rdquo; (Wrap) radical section (勹部, Hōbu), the following instance is problematic:\nkazama_location: K07057620, hanzi_entry: 匑, definition (representing Original Glosses): 音⿺麦羽　又穹　ー𠤂　謹敬皃, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: Although \u0026lsquo;ー𠤂\u0026rsquo; is written in a slightly larger size, it is considered part of the Original Glosses. kazama_location: K07057640, hanzi_entry: 𠤂, definition (representing Original Glosses): 音躬 In the Original Glosses for \u0026lsquo;匑\u0026rsquo; (K07057620), the \u0026lsquo;ー\u0026rsquo; in \u0026lsquo;ー𠤂\u0026rsquo; is a Substitution Mark. Thus, \u0026lsquo;ー𠤂\u0026rsquo; represents \u0026lsquo;匑𠤂\u0026rsquo;, and its semantic meaning is given as \u0026lsquo;謹敬皃\u0026rsquo; (jǐnjìngmào; \u0026ldquo;appearance of being reverent and respectful\u0026rdquo;). Masamune\u0026rsquo;s Kanji Index lists \u0026lsquo;ー（匑）𠤂\u0026rsquo; as an Entry.\nThe character \u0026lsquo;匑\u0026rsquo; appears in the Guangyun with the gloss \u0026ldquo;謹敬之皃。又音穹。\u0026rdquo; (Appearance of being reverent and respectful. Also pronounced qióng [穹]) under the Level tone (平声), Dong (東) rhyme, xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;弓\u0026rsquo; (gōng): jūróng qiè (居戎切); and also as \u0026ldquo;謹敬之皃\u0026rdquo; (Appearance of being reverent and respectful) under the Level tone, Dong rhyme, xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;穹\u0026rsquo; (qióng): qùgōng qiè (去宫切) [Departing tone reading for 穹]. The Phonetic Gloss \u0026ldquo;音⿺麦羽\u0026rdquo; found in the Myōgishō is questionable. However, the accompanying \u0026ldquo;又穹\u0026rdquo; (also qióng) can be seen as indicating a pronunciation from the Level tone, Dong rhyme. Furthermore, \u0026lsquo;匑\u0026rsquo; is found in the Banshō Meigi (万象名義) with \u0026ldquo;丘陸反。謹敬皃\u0026rdquo; and in the Song edition of the Yupian (宋本玉篇) with \u0026ldquo;丘六切。又丘弓切。匑𠤊謹敬皃\u0026rdquo;. Since \u0026lsquo;丘陸反\u0026rsquo; (qiūlù fǎn) and \u0026lsquo;丘六切\u0026rsquo; (qiūliù qiè) correspond to the Entering tone (入声), Wu (屋) rhyme, and Xi (溪) initial, they are likely scribal errors for \u0026lsquo;麴󠄀\u0026rsquo; (yeast/leaven), which has the fanqie spelling \u0026ldquo;驅匊切\u0026rdquo; (qūdī qiè) in the Guangyun.\nThe next Entry, K07057640 for \u0026lsquo;𠤂\u0026rsquo;, has the Phonetic Gloss \u0026ldquo;音躬\u0026rdquo; (pronounced as \u0026lsquo;躬\u0026rsquo;). While \u0026lsquo;𠤂\u0026rsquo; is not found in the Guangyun, the character \u0026lsquo;躬\u0026rsquo; (gōng) cited in the gloss is listed in the Guangyun with the fanqie \u0026ldquo;居戎切\u0026rdquo; (jūróng qiè; Level tone, Dong rhyme, xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;弓\u0026rsquo;), making it homophonous with \u0026lsquo;匑\u0026rsquo;. Although \u0026lsquo;𠤂\u0026rsquo; is not found in the Banshō Meigi, the Song edition of the Yupian, or the Guangyun, it does appear in the Jiyun (集韻) under the entry for \u0026ldquo;𠤂匔\u0026rdquo; with the gloss \u0026ldquo;謹敬也或作匔\u0026rdquo; (Reverent and respectful; also written as 匔) under the Level tone, Dong rhyme, xiaoyun \u0026lsquo;窮\u0026rsquo; (qióng): qúgōng qiè (渠弓切).\nBased on the above, it is difficult to consider \u0026lsquo;ー（匑）𠤂\u0026rsquo; in the Kanchi-in manuscript as a compound word; it is more likely a co-listing of variant characters (itaiji).\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;雨\u0026rdquo; (Rain) radical section (雨部, Ubu), Sakai (1967) counts 226 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 228 Entries, a difference of two Entries. The following example illustrates an instance where the identification of Entries is problematic:\nkazama_location: K07067330, hanzi_entry: 霆, definition (representing Original Glosses): 定（R）亭（L）挺（H）三音　霹靂　イナヒカリ（__LVHL）　イカツチ（H_HV_）, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: \u0026lsquo;霹靂\u0026rsquo; is a Semantic Gloss in Chinese. The characters \u0026lsquo;霹靂\u0026rsquo; (Hekireki; thunderclap) are written in a slightly larger size. Furthermore, while this Entry for \u0026lsquo;霆\u0026rsquo; occupies the space of two cells (or blocks; 2格, nikaku), the segment \u0026lsquo;霹靂　イナヒカリ（__LVHL）\u0026rsquo; is written in the second cell, suggesting it could potentially have been a separate Headword (and thus a distinct Entry). However, since \u0026lsquo;霹靂\u0026rsquo; is listed as a Headword elsewhere in the Myōgishō, and considering its content in this instance, it was judged appropriate to treat it as a phrase within the Original Glosses for \u0026lsquo;霆\u0026rsquo;.\nThe original text for this section can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nAnother problematic instance is the following example. Related preceding and succeeding Entries are also shown for context:\nkazama_location: K07068530, hanzi_entry: 雹, definition: 歩角反　アラレ（HHH）　和ハク　ハウ kazama_location: K07068541, hanzi_entry: 𩅟, definition: 或 kazama_location: K07068542, hanzi_entry: 雹, definition: (Unannotated) kazama_location: K07068611, hanzi_entry: 𩂁／䨔／⿱𩅒田, definition: 俗 The third Entry, K07068542 with Headword \u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo;, appears at the end of its line and might seem continuous with the next Entry on the following line, K07068611 with Headword \u0026lsquo;𩂁／䨔／⿱𩅒田\u0026rsquo;. There is a slight blank space below \u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo; (K07068542). Furthermore, although the Headwords of the first Entry (K07068530) and the third Entry (K07068542) are both transcribed as \u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo;, in the original manuscript, the lower part of the latter (\u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo; in K07068542) is written in a form resembling \u0026lsquo;⿱冖巳\u0026rsquo;. It is thought that a blank space was intentionally left below it to accommodate some form of Note on Character Form.\nHowever, the Headword of the last listed Entry, \u0026lsquo;𩂁／䨔／⿱𩅒田\u0026rsquo; (K07068611), consists of variant characters (itaiji) of \u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo;, as can be seen in the following examples from Volume 2 of the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing (龍龕手鑑), under the \u0026ldquo;雨\u0026rdquo; (Rain) radical. Therefore, it is also conceivable that \u0026lsquo;雹\u0026rsquo; (K07068542) and \u0026lsquo;𩂁／䨔／⿱𩅒田\u0026rsquo; (K07068611) originally constituted a single Entry.\nlocation: Ls52b0802, hanzi_entry: 䨔𩂁𩅒, definition: 三俗。 (Three popular forms.) location: Ls52b0805, hanzi_entry: 𩄉𩅟𩇌, definition: 三古。 (Three old forms.) location: Ls52b0808, hanzi_entry: 雹, definition: 正。蒲各反。雨冰也。七。 (Standard form. Fanqie: 蒲各反 (pú gè fǎn). Means \u0026lsquo;rain and ice\u0026rsquo; (hail). Seven (notes/entries).) A comparison of the Headword characters from the Kanchi-in manuscript and the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing is shown below. Only Notes on Character Form (字体注, jitaichū) are indicated; Phonetic Glosses and Japanese Native Readings (wakun) are omitted. A slash \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; indicates a conceptual line break (for aligning the Kanchi-in sequence). Arabic numerals represent the order of appearance in the Kanchi-in manuscript; \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo; marks characters from the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing list not found in the Kanchi-in manuscript\u0026rsquo;s corresponding sequence, and parentheses () are used for characters that are similar but not identical.\n(Kanchi-in Manuscript) 1…… 2或 3 / 4 5 6俗\n(Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing) 5 4 (6)三俗 x 2 x三古 1正　…\nThe Kanchi-in manuscript sequence involves 6 character forms (or groups), while the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing list shows 7 relevant character forms here. Their order of description does not directly match. The characters marked with \u0026lsquo;x\u0026rsquo;, namely and , from the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing list are not found in the corresponding Kanchi-in manuscript sequence. Character 3 , , and character 6, , from the Kanchi-in manuscript do not have direct identical counterparts in this Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing list. However, character 6 from the Kanchi-in manuscript, , is similar to character (6), , from the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing.\nIt is presumed that the exemplar of a dictionary like the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing that was consulted by the compiler(s) of the revised Kanchi-in manuscript of the Ruiju Myōgishō may have had questionable points or textual corruptions.\nThe original text for this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nThe original text for the relevant section in the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;疒\u0026rdquo; (Sickness) radical section (疒部, Daibu), Sakai (1967) counts 400 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 399 Entries, a difference of one Entry. The identification of Entries is problematic in the following instance:\nkazama_location: K07125841, hanzi_entry: 𤻿／⿸疒既, definition (representing Original Glosses): 俗通　古界反　⿱⿰白旡月　正䐴　𦝫, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: The string \u0026lsquo;⿱⿰白旡月\u0026rsquo; is an example of characters from the Original Glosses being written in a large size. Although the string \u0026lsquo;⿱⿰白旡月\u0026rsquo; is written in a large size and might appear to be a Headword, it does not contain the \u0026lsquo;疒\u0026rsquo; radical component. Therefore, it is not appropriate to classify it as a Headword belonging to the \u0026ldquo;疒\u0026rdquo; (Sickness) radical section.\nThe original text for this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the upper right of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;寸\u0026rdquo; (Inch) radical section (寸部, Sunbu), Sakai (1967) counts 41 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 39 Entries, a difference of two Entries. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K07143741, hanzi_entry: 戈／ー（射）, definition (representing Original Glosses): イツル　六ー　ムツマシ　賭ー　ノリユミ The strings \u0026lsquo;六ー（射）\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;賭ー（射）\u0026rsquo; appearing in the Original Glosses are written in a somewhat larger size. It is considered appropriate to treat each of these, along with their subsequent Japanese Native Readings (wakun), as independent Entries. These are considered Embedded Items (umeji), or compounds presented in the Divided-Annotation Style (Bunchūshiki). If treated this way, this instance is corrected as follows:\nkazama_location: K07143741, hanzi_entry: 戈／ー（射）, definition: イツル, remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: The segment \u0026lsquo;六ー　ムツマシ　賭ー　ノリユミ\u0026rsquo; (originally part of this entry\u0026rsquo;s gloss) is likely an Embedded Item (*umeji*) (or items that should be separate entries). kazama_location: K07143743, hanzi_entry: 六／ー（射）, definition: ムツマシ kazama_location: K07143745, hanzi_entry: 賭／ー（射）, definition: ノリユミ The figures for the \u0026ldquo;寸\u0026rdquo; (Inch) radical section in Ikeda et al.

The corrected figures are shown in bold:\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 080 寸 (Inch) 18 23 0 0 0 0 41 64 For the \u0026ldquo;示\u0026rdquo; (Altar/Display) radical section (示部, Shibu), there is no difference in the number of Entries between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020). However, an Omitted Character is recognized in the Headword of the following Entry:\nkazama_location: K0700183, hanzi_entry: 樹／［神］, definition: コタマ（LHL） As a result of supplying this omitted character, the breakdown of Entry counts by headword length and the total headword character count for this section are presented as follows (the total number of Entries, 232, remains unchanged):\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 061 示 (Altar/Display) 198 27 6 0 1 0 232 275 Sōjō (僧上 – Upper \u0026ldquo;Sangha\u0026rdquo; Fascicle) # In the Sōjō section, discrepancies in Entry counts between Sakai (1967) and Ikeda et al. (2020) are found for the following two radical sections. The figures presented in the table below are from Ikeda et al.

(2020) count 103 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K08100641, hanzi_entry: ⿱三毛／⿱介毳／毳／𣯝, definition (representing Original Glosses): マコケ（HHLV）　カモ（HH）　音脆（R）「セイ」, remarks (Compiler's Remark): The Japanese Native Readings (wakun) are written as if they are side-line kun readings for \u0026lsquo;毳\u0026rsquo;. Corrected to treat \u0026lsquo;⿱三毛／⿱介毳／毳／𣯝\u0026rsquo; as a single Entry. As noted in the remarks (the Compiler's Remark), the two Japanese Native Readings (wakun) are written as if they are side-line kun readings for the character \u0026lsquo;毳\u0026rsquo;. Furthermore, in the original manuscript layout, there is a line break after \u0026lsquo;毳\u0026rsquo;, and \u0026lsquo;𣯝\u0026rsquo; appears as a Headword at the beginning of the next line.\nSince the character \u0026lsquo;𣯝\u0026rsquo; may not display correctly in all environments, the Headword in question, along with its associated readings from the Original Glosses, is shown using GlyphWiki images as follows. A slash \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; indicates a line break as found in the Kanchi-in manuscript\u0026rsquo;s layout for this entry:\nマコケ（HHLV）　カモ（HH） / 音脆（R）「セイ」\nThe character \u0026lsquo;毳\u0026rsquo; (sui, zei) has two pronunciations in the Guangyun: \u0026ldquo;此芮切\u0026rdquo; (cǐ ruì qiè; Departing tone, 祭韻, 清母 Qing initial) and \u0026ldquo;楚税切\u0026rdquo; (chǔ shuì qiè; Departing tone, 祭韻, 穿二母 Chuan II initial, for the character 㯔). The character \u0026lsquo;脆\u0026rsquo; also has the fanqie \u0026ldquo;此芮切\u0026rdquo;. The Shuowen Jiezi, under the \u0026ldquo;毳\u0026rdquo; radical section, states: \u0026ldquo;獸細毛也。从三毛。凡毳之屬皆从毳。\u0026rdquo; (Fine animal fur. Composed of three \u0026lsquo;毛\u0026rsquo; (fur) characters. All characters belonging to the 毳 category are derived from 毳). Considering this, it is appropriate to treat these four characters (, , , and ) collectively as a single Basic Entry. The Renjō-in manuscript also treats these four characters as a single Entry.\nRegarding the Japanese Native Readings (wakun): The wakun \u0026ldquo;カモ\u0026rdquo; (kamo) is listed in the Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (Nikkoku) under the entry for \u0026ldquo;かも 【氈】\u0026rdquo; with the definition: \u0026ldquo;A carpet woven from animal fur; also refers to woolen products in general. Also ori-kamo.\u0026rdquo; Examples are found in the Shinsen Jikyō and the Wamyō Ruijushō. The wakun \u0026ldquo;マコゲ\u0026rdquo; (makoge) is not listed in the Nikkoku. Masamune\u0026rsquo;s Kana Index records \u0026ldquo;マコゲ\u0026rdquo;. However, Mochizuki\u0026rsquo;s Wakun Shūsei and Kusakawa\u0026rsquo;s Wakun Shūsei list it as \u0026ldquo;ニコゲ\u0026rdquo; (nikoge) with a mama (i.e., \u0026ldquo;as is,\u0026rdquo; indicating a direct transcription of a possibly problematic form) note. The Maeda-bon manuscript of the Iroha Jiruishō, under the entry for \u0026lsquo;毳\u0026rsquo;, shows \u0026ldquo;ニコゲ (HHLV)\u0026rdquo;. The Nikkoku defines \u0026ldquo;ニコゲ\u0026rdquo; (nikoge) as: \u0026ldquo;Fine, soft, short animal fur; also soft human hair. Ubuge (downy hair), watage (fluff).\u0026rdquo; Examples are found in the Wamyō Ruijushō and other texts.\nThe original text for this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nIncidentally, Volume 1 of the Longkan Shoujian/Shoujing (龍龕手鑑), under the \u0026ldquo;毛\u0026rdquo; (Fur) radical section, shows the following related entries:\n四俗。 (Four popular forms.) 正。七稅昌稅二反。鳥獸細茸毛也。又斷也。亦姓五。 (Standard form. Fanqie spellings: 七稅反 (qī shuì fǎn) and 昌稅反 (chāng shuì fǎn). Meaning: \u0026lsquo;Fine downy fur of birds and beasts. Also means to cut. Also a surname.\u0026rsquo; Five (notes/entries in total for this group).)\nThe Entry count and total headword character count for the \u0026ldquo;毛\u0026rdquo; (Fur) radical section are corrected as follows:\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 086 毛 (Fur) 59 30 9 1 0 0 103 173 For the \u0026ldquo;食\u0026rdquo; (Eat/Food) radical section (食部, Shokubu), Sakai (1967) counts 214 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 213 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K08104831, hanzi_entry: 餬／𩚩, definition (representing Original Glosses): 「カユ」　「モラフ（HHL）」　今正　音胡　鬻〈正〉　饘也　モラフ（HHL）　ネヤス（LH_）　ヒサク（HH_）, remarks (Compiler's Remark): An example noted as \u0026lsquo;unknown\u0026rsquo; (未詳, mishō) in the Wamyō Ruijushō but not present in the Myōgishō in this form; see Senchūbon Wamyōshō (Annotated Edition of the Wamyō Ruijushō), Vol. 4, p. 48 verso (Okada\u0026rsquo;s research, p. 97). The Japanese Native Readings (wakun) \u0026lsquo;カユ\u0026rsquo; (kayu) and \u0026lsquo;モラフ\u0026rsquo; (morau; HHL) are written to the bottom right and bottom left, respectively, of the Headword \u0026lsquo;餬\u0026rsquo;. While they could potentially be seen as constituting independent Entries, the Headword \u0026lsquo;餬／𩚩\u0026rsquo; is an example of co-listed variant characters (itaiji). Furthermore, the Original Glosses include the Form Classification Tag \u0026lsquo;今正\u0026rsquo; (konsei; \u0026ldquo;current/standard\u0026rdquo;), and the Renjō-in manuscript treats \u0026lsquo;餬／𩚩\u0026rsquo; as a single Entry.\nAnother problematic instance is the following example:\nkazama_location: K08110441, hanzi_entry: 䬭／𩚓／𩚾／𩜻／䬢／⿱⿰号丙食, definition: 俗 (Popular form) As this Headword contains many complex or rare characters, it is shown below using GlyphWiki images.

(2020) count 379 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K10008640, hanzi_entry: 鰐, definition: 音萼　ワニ（LL） kazama_location: K10008711, hanzi_entry: 鱷, definition: 或 kazama_location: K10008712, hanzi_entry: 𩻙, definition: 正 kazama_location: K10008713, hanzi_entry: 鰐, definition: (Unannotated) kazama_location: K10008720, hanzi_entry: 䱟, definition: *フナ In the original Kanchi-in manuscript, the last two characters (\u0026lsquo;鰐\u0026rsquo; from K10008713 and \u0026lsquo;䱟\u0026rsquo; from K10008720) are written as if they form a single Entry. These two characters are not listed as Headwords in the Renjō-in manuscript.\nThe sequence of glyphs and the wakun \u0026lsquo;フナ\u0026rsquo; appears as:\n1音萼　ワニ(LL) (with its own glosses)\n2或 (annotated 或 - variant)\n3正 (annotated 正 - standard)\n4 (unannotated)\n5 フナ (funa)\nIndeed, it is conceivable that the Japanese Native Reading (wakun) \u0026lsquo;フナ\u0026rsquo; (funa) was intended as an annotation for both characters (4) and (5) together.\nAlternatively, at some stage of the revised compilation, there might have been a perceived difference in glyph form between (1) and (4), and they might have been listed to distinguish them. The three characters (2), (3), and (4) are written within a single cell (1マス, hitomasu). The common kun reading for \u0026lsquo;鰐\u0026rsquo; is \u0026lsquo;ワニ\u0026rsquo; (wani), so it is hesitant to read it as \u0026lsquo;フナ\u0026rsquo; (funa). It is preferable to consider \u0026lsquo;フナ\u0026rsquo; as corresponding only to \u0026lsquo;䱟\u0026rsquo;.\nThe original text for this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;虫\u0026rdquo; (Insect) radical section (虫部, Chūbu), Sakai (1967) counts 665 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 664 Entries, a difference of one Entry.

(2020) count 75 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instances:\nkazama_location: K10048541, hanzi_entry: 𩲀／𩱿／⿱勿鬼 (line break)／𩲢／𩲑／𩲝／䰨／𩴎, definition: 俗 This is an Entry listing variant characters (itaiji), but there is a line break in the middle of the Headword.\nkazama_location: K10050340, hanzi_entry: ⿰我鬼, definition: (Unannotated), remarks (Compiler's Remark): Ikeda\u0026rsquo;s note: Could this be continuous with the following \u0026lsquo;Unknown\u0026rsquo; (未詳, mishō) Entry? kazama_location: K10050411, hanzi_entry: 𩴜／⿺鬼有／⿺鬼麦／⿺鬼同／⿺鬼達／⿺鬼田／⿺鬼能／⿺鬼幸／⿺鬼𦍬／⿰田鬼, definition: 未詳 (Unknown) These were counted as two Entries, but if \u0026lsquo;⿰我鬼\u0026rsquo; (K10050340) is continuous with the following \u0026lsquo;Unknown\u0026rsquo; Entry, the count would decrease by one.\nThe original text for these sections in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the right side of the corresponding page and the right side of the following page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nFor the \u0026ldquo;雑\u0026rdquo; (Miscellaneous) radical section (雑部, Zatsubu), Sakai (1967) counts 1,500 Entries, while Ikeda et al. (2020) count 1,501 Entries, a difference of one Entry. This discrepancy is thought to be related to the following instance:\nkazama_location: K10081830, hanzi_entry: ■, definition: ツミ kazama_location: K10081840, hanzi_entry: 𡿨, definition: (Unannotated), remarks (Compiler's Remark): A variant character (*itaiji*) of \u0026lsquo;甽\u0026rsquo;.

It can be confirmed in the Kichō Tosho Fukuseikai edition and both the old and new Tenri editions, but it is an easily overlooked example.\nThe original text for this section in the Kanchi-in manuscript can be referred to on the left side of the corresponding page in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.\nAlso in the \u0026ldquo;雑\u0026rdquo; (Miscellaneous) radical section, there was an error in the data for the following Entry:\nkazama_location: K10075411, hanzi_entry: 多／少, definition: ソコハク（LHLVL） The Headword was previously misidentified as only \u0026lsquo;多\u0026rsquo; and has been corrected to \u0026lsquo;多／少\u0026rsquo;.\nAs a result of these corrections, the breakdown of Entry counts by headword length and the total headword character count for this section are as follows:\nNo. Radical 1-char 2-char 3-char 4-char 5-char 6+ char No. of Entries No. of Chars 120 雑 (Miscellaneous) 1,075 332 73 14 4 4 1,501 2,057 Summary of Entry Counts and Total Headword Character Counts by Radical Section # It was necessary to correct the Entry counts from Ikeda et al. (2020) for the following three radical sections: No. 001 \u0026ldquo;人\u0026rdquo; (Man), No. 029 \u0026ldquo;木\u0026rdquo; (Tree), and No. 080 \u0026ldquo;寸\u0026rdquo; (Inch). For other radical sections where discrepancies with other tallies (e.g., Sakai (1967)) exist, these variations are generally due to differences in the criteria for identifying and counting Entries. In such cases, the counts from Ikeda et al. (2020) have been retained as is. Reflecting the corrections made based on the verifications discussed above, a complete list of Entry counts for all radical sections is provided below.

観智院本の水部、冫部、言部の範囲について、 注文中の漢字字体の記載状況をまとめると次の表のようになる。 分類と数値は張馨方の調査による。\n記載形式 字級 用例 ○★ ○正 17 ○俗 8 ○今 2 ○或 25 ○古 2 ○俗通 1 小計 55 ★○ 正○ 2 俗○ 8 或○ 1 古○ 1 小計 12 ★為○ 或為○ 1 小計 1 ★作○ 或作○ 1 小計 1 ★○字 正○字 11 俗○字 149 通○字 2 今○字 2 或○字 25 古○字 4 俗通○字 1 小計 194 ★為○字 今為○字 1 小計 1 合計 「滴」とその関連項目 # 観智院本の 「滴」の記載 # 張馨方が例としてあげる 「滴」（観智院本法上23）をとりあげて、記載形式と字級のありようを検討してみよう。 字体注記は太字とする。\n二正 或 二俗 俗滳字\n張馨方は簡略化して記載しているので、次には注文の全体をあげておこう。適宜改行を入れ、番号を付した。\n二正　丁狄反　シタヽル(LL@@)　音的　アマツヒ 或 二俗 音商　阿懸名 音帝　音テイ(LH)　シタヽル(LLL\u0026quot;L)　アマツヒ　水ツミ　又都歴反　俗滳字 1、2、3はいずれも「○★」の記載形式である。1は音注「丁狄反」と和訓「シタヽル」から考えて、であろう。「滴」は 万象名義と新撰字鏡でもの字形としている。 CHISEの検索 で確認できる。「滴」はHNGに収録されていないが、「啇」を漢字の構成要素に持つ「適」は、 日本写本（弥勒上生、院政大教、仏説大教）では「啇」の部分を「商」の字形としている。\n一方、4は1のと同じ字形だが、注文に「音商　阿懸名」とあり、「滳」と考えられる。\n1は虫損があり、判読に難があるが、正宗索引は1の、3の、4のを、同じ字形に判読している。\n蓮成院本の 「滴」の記載 # 観智院本以外の改編本において、この箇所が残るのは蓮成院本であるが、そこには次のように見えている（中一12裏）。\n二正　丁狄反　シタヽル(LL@@)　アマツヒ　音的 或 二俗 音商　阿懸名 音帝　音テイ(LL)　アマツヒ　シタヽル(LLL\u0026quot;L)　水ツミ　又都歴反　俗滳字 1ののしんにょう（辶）は原文で1点であるが、作字の都合で2点となっている。\n蓮成院本では、観智院本で同一字形であった1、3、4のをそれぞれ、、と区別している。\n蓮成院本の記載内容が観智院本よりも整っており、合理的な内容となっている。 ただ、蓮成院本のような記載内容が崩れて観智院本のようになったのか、観智院本の記載内容に矛盾があるのでそれを正して蓮成院本になったのか、この例だけで判断するのは難しい。類例を集めて検討する必要があろう。\nなお、注文では、1の記載順序に相違がある。ただし、観智院本は3行書きの注文となっていて不審である。本来は2行書きであり、「音的」が注文末にあったと推測される。蓮成院本はこの箇所を3行書きとしているが、和訓の後の注文末に「音的」があって通例にかなっている。\n龍龕手鏡の 「滴」の記載 # 龍龕手鏡（鑑）では、水部は巻二に収録され、高麗本を欠くが、宋本に「滴」は次のように見える（巻二水部第三・入声）。\n俗 今 二正音的水ー也四 この3項目は「滴」に関連した内容である。 改編本と比べると記載の順序と字級に相違がある。 改編本は、「二正」\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;「或」\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;「二俗」の順序で、「二正」が 最初にあるが、 龍龕手鑑は、「俗」\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;「今」\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;「二正」の順序で、「二正」が最後にある。 字級を見ると、を「俗」、 を「正」とする点は一致するが、 改編本はを「正」、龍龕手鑑は近似する字形のを「今」としている。また、 を改編本は「或」、龍龕手鑑は「正」とする相違がある。\n一方、「滳」は別の箇所に見えている（巻二水部第三・平声）\n音商ー河縣名又都歴反\n「滳」に同音字注「音商」、意義注「ー河縣名」、又音の反切「又都歴反」を記載する。 意義注に「ー河縣名」とあるのは「滳河」は「縣名」であるという意味である。 隋書に「滳河開皇十六年置」とあり、開皇十六年（596）に設置された県名である。 現在の山東省済南市に位置する商河県である。 改編本の「阿懸名」は文意通らず不審であったが、「阿」は「河」の誤写としてよいであろう。 「滳河、縣名」と区切って理解すべきなのを「滳、河縣名」と区切って理解したために 生じた誤りと考えられる。 それはともかく、県名（地名）の「滳河」として用いる時は「音商」であり、 それとは別に「又都歴反」の音があるという説明である。 「滴」は広韻に「水滴也，亦作𤁷」（入声錫韻）、的：都歴切)とあり、 「又都歴反」は「滴」に対応することを知る。つまり、 「滳」は県名（地名）「滳河」では「音商」であるが、 「都歴反」の「滴」に通用して用いられることを示している。\n「滴」とその関連項目は、原撰本たる図書寮本に詳細な記載があり、種々検討すべきであるが、 ひとまずここまでとしておく。\n李景遠『隋唐字様學研究』國立臺灣師範大學國文研究所博士論文、1997\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n張馨方「注文中の漢字字体の記載からみた改編本系『類聚名義抄』」『北海道大学大学院文学研究科研究論集』17 、2017\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":24,"href":"/en/docs/krm/05-annotation-policy/05-04-onchu-problems/","title":"Types and Decipherment Problems of Pronunciation Notes","section":"Basic Policy for Annotation Creation","content":"Under preparation.\nTypes and Decipherment Problems of Pronunciation Notes # 音注の検討では、広韻の音注との比較が基本となる。 原撰本名義抄では、東宮切韻の引用頻度が高く、 切韻系韻書に由来する音注が改編本でも多くなっていると 予想される。 原撰本名義抄では、この他に原本玉篇、万象名義の引用が多い 東宮切韻と同程度あり、観智院本の音注についても照合が必要である。原撰本名義抄で引用頻度が 最も多いのは玄応の一切経音義であり、同様に観智院本の音注と一切経音義との照合するが必要である。 また、原撰本名義抄には和名抄由来の音注もあり、漢語の中古音の体系と相違することがある。\nしかし、観智院本の音注は数え方にもよるが、約24,000あり、照合には時間を要する まずは、広韻を参考にして、掲出字の有無、所属韻、反切、小韻字などを調査する。 次に広韻に一致しない音注を、万象名義、宋本玉篇、一切経音義、 和名抄などについて、順次検討して行くということにする。\n原撰本名義抄では直接的な引用はないが、改編本には龍龕手鏡の類似する項目があるので、 龍龕手鏡の参照も欠かせない。\n音注の種類 #

Introduction # This document outlines methods for typesetting transcriptions and annotations of old dictionaries using an environment comprising LuaTeX, Hanazono Mincho fonts, GlyphWiki, and the sfkanbun.sty package.\nIt is recommended to use LuaTeX via TeX Live and VS Code as the editor. Instructions for installing and using TeX Live and VS Code are widely available on the web and will be omitted here.\nTypesetting Transcriptions and Annotations # The transcriptions and annotations that have been created can be displayed and searched on the web.\nSeparately from this, we will consider methods for typesetting the web content into a more readable, book-like format.\nSince the web content is written in Markdown, this can be addressed by converting it to an appropriate format.\nThis section serves as a memorandum on a method using LuaLaTeX.\nRequirements for Typesetting Software # Old dictionaries and kunten materials (訓点資料, documents annotated with guiding marks for reading Chinese texts in Japanese) often contain many complex Hanzi (Chinese characters), and their texts, including features like Interlinear Notes (割注, warichū) and side-line kun readings (傍訓, bōkun), can be intricate.\nFor displaying and printing rare or complex characters, it is essential to be able to easily use the following two resources:\nHanazono Mincho (花園明朝) fonts GlyphWiki To utilize both of these resources, LuaLaTeX appears to be a suitable choice. While upLaTeX might also be usable, configuring it to work with these resources seems likely to be a challenging endeavor.\nFor complex typesetting features such as Interlinear Notes and side-line kun readings, macro files can be used. Several such files have been publicly released:\nkunten2e.sty: A style file for kunten materials. sfkanbun.sty: The sfkanbun package (for Kanbun texts). Both of these can be used with upLaTeX. However, they cannot be used directly with LuaLaTeX as is. After some investigation, it was found that sfkanbun.sty can be made compatible with LuaLaTeX by modifying its files slightly. The necessary modifications are minimal.\nIt has been over 20 years since I last created document files using LaTeX. At that time, I utilized the following combination:\nkunten2e.sty: The style file for kunten materials. mojikyo.sty: For using Mojikyo fonts. It would be convenient if LaTeX document files written with these two could be made usable with only minor revisions. In other words, easy reuse of older LaTeX document files is preferable.\nMigrating from kunten2e.sty to sfkanbun.sty appears to be relatively straightforward.\nWhile mojikyo.sty was useful when Unicode Hanzi (Chinese characters) could not be freely used, it is no longer necessary now that Unicode Hanzi (Chinese characters) can be input and processed directly.\nThe approach would be to enable the use of Hanazono Mincho fonts and then utilize bxglyphwiki.sty, which is compatible with LuaLaTeX, for GlyphWiki integration.\nSetting up Hanazono Mincho Setting up GlyphWiki Setting up sfkanbun.sty A Memorandum on LuaTeX Typesetting for Old Dictionaries and Kunten Materials Online Tools "},{"id":29,"href":"/en/docs/krm/06-typesetting/06-01-hanazono-mincho/","title":"Setting up Hanazono Mincho","section":"Typesetting Configuration for Transcriptions and Annotations","content":" Setting up Hanazono Mincho # Prerequisites # Ensure that TeX Live is set up and ready to use.\nHanazono Fonts # Install the Hanazono Mincho fonts on your computer.\nBrowser Confirmation # For example, open a page from the ctext.org Dictionary (e.g., radicals section) in the Chrome browser.

Some existing document files were created using this kunten2e.sty style file.\nThe sfkanbun package (sfkanbun.sty for Kanbun texts) originates from the work on Typesetting Kanbun with Kundoku Marks (漢文の訓点文の組版), featured in \u0026ldquo;Introduction to Vertical and Horizontal Document Composition\u0026rdquo; (入門・縦横文書術) by Fujita Shinsaku. A modified version of this style file, adapted for LuaLaTeX compatibility and renamed sfkanbun-lua.sty, has been made available at https://github.com/shikeda/rose.\nTherefore, to minimize changes to existing TeX source files, frequently used macros in kunten2e.sty have been mapped to macros in sfkanbun.sty that provide equivalent functionality, or compatibility has been otherwise ensured.\nSōgyō (双行 - Double-Line Annotations) # Sōgyō (双行) refers to a type of Interlinear Note (割注, warichū), specifically one that is typically presented in two lines.\nIn kunten2e.sty, this is input as follows:\n\\sougyou{right-hand line}{left-hand line} (In vertical text, the \u0026ldquo;right-hand line\u0026rdquo; is typically the first line of the two-line note, and the \u0026ldquo;left-hand line\u0026rdquo; is the second.)\nIn sfkanbun.sty, the \\tagyobox command (for multi-line interlinear notes) is used:\n\\tagyobox{item 1 \\\\ item 2 \\\\ ...} Since an Interlinear Note (warichū) often consists of just two lines (corresponding to \u0026ldquo;item 1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;item 2\u0026rdquo; above), the following custom LaTeX command can be defined to simplify input for such cases:\n\\newcommand{\\sougyou}[2]{\\tagyobox{#1 \\\\ #2}} Nested Double-Line Annotations (副双行, Fukusōgyō) # A fukusōgyō (副双行) refers to creating an additional double-line annotation (sōgyō) within an existing sōgyō (double-line interlinear note). In kunten2e.sty, this is input as follows:\n\\hukusougyou{right-hand line}{left-hand line} This functionality can be achieved in sfkanbun.sty using its feature for nested multi-line interlinear notes (\\fukutagyobox).\n\\fukutagyobox{item 1 \\\\ item 2 \\\\ ...} Since a nested double-line annotation typically requires only two items (lines), the following custom LaTeX command can be defined to simplify input for such cases:\n\\newcommand{\\hukusougyou}[2]{\\fukutagyobox{#1 \\\\ #2}} Okurigana and Kaeriten Marks (送り仮名、返り点) # The \\kundoku command from sfkanbun.sty is useful for typesetting okurigana (送り仮名, inflectional kana endings) and kaeriten (返り点, guiding marks for Japanese reading order of Kanbun). Its syntax is:\n\\kundoku[control_options]{base_character}{ruby_text}{okurigana}{kaeriten_mark}[shoulder_kaeriten_mark](punctuation_mark) The (punctuation_mark) argument is optional.\nRuby (ルビ) # Several macros are available for using ruby (ルビ, small phonetic glosses alongside characters). After experimentation, we decided to use luatexja-ruby.sty.\nThe basic syntax is:\n\\ltjruby[⟨option⟩]{親|文|字}{おや|も|じ} In this example, the command specifies that the ruby text \u0026lsquo;おや\u0026rsquo; (oya) is to be applied to the base character \u0026lsquo;親\u0026rsquo;; \u0026lsquo;も\u0026rsquo; (mo) to \u0026lsquo;文\u0026rsquo;; and \u0026lsquo;じ\u0026rsquo; (ji) to \u0026lsquo;字\u0026rsquo;.\nAn alias \\ruby is also defined for this command.\nAlthough the exact circumstances are no longer recalled, ruby was previously applied using a custom command named \\ukun. To avoid rewriting original files that used this command, \\ukun has been (re)defined as follows:\n\\newcommand{\\ukun}[2]{\\ltjruby{#1}{#2}} Alternatively, all instances of \\ukun could be globally replaced with \\ruby.\n"},{"id":32,"href":"/en/docs/krm/06-typesetting/06-04-vscode-texlive/","title":"A Memorandum on LuaTeX Typesetting for Old Dictionaries and Kunten Materials","section":"Typesetting Configuration for Transcriptions and Annotations","content":" A Memorandum on LuaTeX Typesetting for Old Dictionaries and Kunten Materials # This document is a memorandum detailing the setup methods for typesetting transcriptions and annotations of old dictionaries and kunten materials.
