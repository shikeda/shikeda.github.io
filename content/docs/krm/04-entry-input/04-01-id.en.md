# Headwords, Entry Structure, and ID System

This section explains the structure of **`Entries`** in the *Myōgishō* and the ID system used to identify them.

## Definitions of Headwords and Entries

A **`Headword`** refers to the **`Chinese character`** or string of **`Chinese characters`** that forms the heading.
An **`Entry`** is the basic unit of the dictionary, typically consisting of a **`Headword`** and its associated **`Original Glosses`**.

In the *Myōgishō*, the **`Headword`** of an **`Entry`** consists of either a **single `Chinese character`** or **multiple `Chinese characters`** (a multi-character compound).

**`Entries`** are presented in two forms based on their **`Headwords`**:
* **`Single Character Form`**: When the **`Headword`** is a single **`Chinese character`**.
* **`Multi-Character Form`**: When the **`Headword`** consists of multiple **`Chinese characters`**.

**`Multi-Character Form`** **`Entries`** include those for **idioms (or compounds)** and those that **co-list `variant characters` (*itaiji*)**.

Below are some examples of these two forms:

**Examples:**
* **`Single Character Form`**: 人, 何
* **`Multi-Character Form`** (idioms/compounds): 一人, 二人, 何如, 如何
* **`Multi-Character Form`** (co-listing **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)**): 爲為, 羱𦍘

The distinction between **`Multi-Character Form`** **`Entries`** for idioms/compounds and those co-listing **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)** is determined by the content of the **`Original Glosses`**.
For example, in '爲為', which co-lists **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)**, the **`Original Glosses`** contain the **`Form Classification Tag`** '正今' (*sei kin*). This indicates that '爲' is the 'standard' (*sei*) form and '為' is the 'current/modern' (*kin*) form, thus establishing their relationship as variants.
Similarly, for '羱𦍘', the **`Original Glosses`** contain the **`Form Classification Tag`** '正俗' (*sei zoku*), indicating that '羱' is the 'standard' (*sei*) form and '𦍘' is the 'popular/vulgar' (*zoku*) form, confirming their variant relationship.

## Principles and Exceptions in the Arrangement of Entries

A single page in the *Myōgishō* is typically composed of 8 lines (rows) and 4 segments (columns per line). In other words, each page has a layout of 8 vertical lines and 4 horizontal segments, totaling 32 cells (or blocks) for entries.

The overwhelming majority of **`Entries`** are "single-segment, single-entry" (一段一項目, *ichidan ikkōmoku*), meaning one **`Entry`** is written within a single cell.

When an explanation (i.e., the **`Original Glosses`**) is lengthy, it may occupy two or more cells, extending over multiple segments or multiple lines. Such "multi-segment, single-entry" (多段一項目, *tadan ikkōmoku*) instances also appear frequently. However, even with lengthy explanations, an **`Entry`** never extends beyond a single page.
Thus, the general principle is that a single cell contains one **`Entry`** or less.

As an exception, two **`Entries`** may occasionally be found within a single segment. These "single-segment, multi-entry" (一段多項目, *ichidan takōmoku*) cases account for less than 1% of the total.

Bearing these principles and exceptions in mind, we will now explain the ID system for the *Myōgishō*. 
The complexity of the *Myōgishō*'s ID system stems largely from this occasional practice of recording two **`Entries`** within a single segment, a point to which users of this data should pay particular attention.


## ID System of the *Myōgishō*

### Types of IDs

In the *Myōgishō* data, **`Entries`** and individual character positions within **`Headwords`** are primarily managed by the following columns:

* **`Entry`** ID (`entry_id` - e.g., F00001) - F-format
* **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id` - e.g., S00001) - S-format
* Kazama Edition Location (`kazama_location` - e.g., K0100131) - K-format
* Tenri Edition Location (`tenri_location` - e.g., Ta023310) - T-format

### Relationship Between Columns

The **`Entry`** ID (`entry_id`) identifies one or more **`Headword`** Character IDs (`hanzi_id`) that constitute the **`Headword`** of that **`Entry`**.

The **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id`) is the primary key that uniquely identifies each individual character position within the data structure (particularly in files like `krm_headword_chars`).

Each **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id`) is linked to corresponding location IDs (for the Kazama and Tenri editions).

The establishment of these four types of IDs accommodates the diversity of **`Entries`** in the *Myōgishō* and facilitates the use of multiple facsimile editions. For this reason, explanations of the F-format, S-format, K-format, and T-format IDs are provided repeatedly as needed, even if it involves some redundancy.

### Detailed Format of Primary IDs

#### **`Entry`** ID (`entry_id` / F-format)

**Format:**
The **`Entry`** ID (`entry_id`) is a 5-digit number prefixed with 'F', forming a sequential series from F00001 to F32604.
For some additionally inserted **`Entries`**, a 'b' suffix is appended to the numeric part of the ID.
It should be noted that while a 'b' suffix may also be appended to the **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id` described below), the 'b' suffix for an `entry_id` is assigned independently of any 'b' suffix on a `hanzi_id`.

**Purpose:**
To uniquely identify each **`Entry`** in the *Myōgishō*.

#### **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id` / S-format)

**Format:**
The **`Headword`** Character ID (`hanzi_id`) is a 5-digit number prefixed with 'S', forming a sequential series from S00001 to S42328. This is the S-format.
For some additionally inserted **`Headword`** characters, a 'b' suffix is appended to the numeric part of the ID.
It should be noted that while a 'b' suffix may also be appended to the **`Entry`** ID (`entry_id` mentioned above), the 'b' suffix for a `hanzi_id` is assigned independently of any 'b' suffix on an `entry_id`.

**Purpose:**
To serve as the primary key that uniquely identifies each individual **`Headword`** character (i.e., each character position) within the dataset.

**Supplement:**
A separate data file lists all **`Headword`** Character IDs (`hanzi_id`), including those for the second and subsequent characters in multi-character **`Headwords`**. This file is [`krm_headword_chars`](/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-03-headword-chars/), the details of which are described elsewhere.


#### Kazama Edition Location (`kazama_location` / K-format)

**Format:**
K + Volume (2 digits) + Kazama Edition Page number (3 digits) + Line number (1 digit) + Segment number (1 digit) + Character Order (1 digit).
This is the K-format.

**Character Order (1 digit):**
This digit is a number assigned based on the type of **`Entry`** (single-character or multi-character) and its order of appearance within that segment.
While the "Character Order" is fundamentally a criterion based on individual character positions, it is used here to indicate the location of an **`Entry`** by referencing the position of the **first character** of that **`Entry`** within the segment.

The use of a character-position-based criterion for this "Character Order" digit is specifically to address the exceptional cases where two or more **`Entries`** are recorded within a single segment (which can also be thought of as a single cell or block in the layout).

To apply this character-position-based criterion representatively for the "Character Order," the following rules for determining this digit have been established:

* **Case 1: If there is only one `Entry` in the segment**
    * If the **`Entry`** is a **`single-character Entry`**, the Character Order is **0**.
    * If the **`Entry`** is a **`multi-character Entry`**, the Character Order is **1**.
* **Case 2: If there are two or more `Entries` in the segment**
    * For the **first `Entry`** in the segment, the Character Order is **1**.
    * For the **second or subsequent `Entries`** in the segment, the Character Order indicates **the position of the first character of that `Entry`, counted sequentially from the beginning of the segment** (where the first character position in the segment is counted as 1).

For example, consider a segment containing 'A' and then 'BC', where 'A' is the 1st character in the segment, 'B' is the 2nd, and 'C' is the 3rd. The **`Entry`** 'BC' is the second **`Entry`** in this segment. Its first character is 'B', which is the 2nd character from the beginning of the segment. Therefore, the Character Order for the **`Entry`** 'BC' is **2**.
Alternatively, consider a segment containing 'AB' and then 'CD', where 'A' is the 1st character, 'B' the 2nd, 'C' the 3rd, and 'D' the 4th. The **`Entry`** 'CD' is the second **`Entry`** in this segment. Its first character is 'C', which is the 3rd character from the beginning of the segment. Therefore, the Character Order for the **`Entry`** 'CD' is **3**.

**Examples of `kazama_location` IDs:**
* `K01001310`: (Indicates a **`single-character Entry`**, one **`Entry`** per segment) Volume 1, Page 1, Line 3, Segment 1, **Character Order 0**.
* `K08084411`: (Indicates a **`multi-character Entry`**, one **`Entry`** per segment) Volume 8, Page 84, Line 4, Segment 1, **Character Order 1**.
* `K01004241`: (Indicates the **first `Entry`** when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Volume 1, Page 4, Line 2, Segment 4, **Character Order 1**.
* `K01004242`: (Indicates an **`Entry`** starting from the **2nd character position** within the segment, when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Volume 1, Page 4, Line 2, Segment 4, **Character Order 2**.
* `K01008341`: (Indicates the **first `Entry`** when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Volume 1, Page 8, Line 3, Segment 4, **Character Order 1**.
* `K01008343`: (Indicates an **`Entry`** starting from the **3rd character position** within the segment, when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Volume 1, Page 8, Line 3, Segment 4, **Character Order 3**.

**Purpose:**
To indicate the location of an **`Entry`** in the Kazama Edition. This ID system is determined based on rules for indicating character position, designed to accommodate all various arrangement patterns of **`Entries`**: the primarily used "single-segment, single-entry" arrangement; the frequently occurring "multi-segment, single-entry" arrangement; and the rare "single-segment, multi-entry" arrangement.

#### Tenri Edition Location (`tenri_location` / T-format)

The Tenri Edition Location (`tenri_location`) follows principles similar to those for determining the K-format of the Kazama Edition Location. Its format, Character Order, and purpose are defined as follows:

**Format:**
T + Volume (a/b/c) + Page number (3 digits) + Line number (1 digit) + Segment number (1 digit) + Character Order (1 digit).
This is the T-format.

**Character Order (1 digit):**
This digit is a number assigned based on the type of **`Entry`** (single-character or multi-character) and its order of appearance within that segment.
While the "Character Order" is fundamentally a criterion based on individual character positions, it is used here to indicate the location of an **`Entry`** by referencing the position of the **first character** of that **`Entry`** within the segment.

The use of a character-position-based criterion for this "Character Order" digit is specifically to address the exceptional cases where two or more **`Entries`** are recorded within a single segment (which can also be thought of as a single cell or block in the layout).

To apply this character-position-based criterion representatively for the "Character Order," the following rules for determining this digit have been established:

* **Case 1: If there is only one `Entry` in the segment**
    * If the **`Entry`** is a **`single-character Entry`**, the Character Order is **0**.
    * If the **`Entry`** is a **`multi-character Entry`**, the Character Order is **1**.
* **Case 2: If there are two or more `Entries` in the segment**
    * For the **first `Entry`** in the segment, the Character Order is **1**.
    * For the **second or subsequent `Entries`** in the segment, the Character Order indicates **the position of the first character of that `Entry`, counted sequentially from the beginning of the segment** (where the first character position in the segment is counted as 1).

The method for indicating the Tenri Edition Location is based on the same principles as that for the Kazama Edition Location. The examples used to explain the Kazama Edition Location, if shown as Tenri Edition Locations, would be as follows (using hypothetical Tenri IDs for illustration, actual examples below):

**Examples of `tenri_location` IDs:**
* `Ta023310`: (Indicates a **`single-character Entry`**, one **`Entry`** per segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 23, Line 3, Segment 1, **Character Order 0**.
* `Tc090411`: (Indicates a **`multi-character Entry`**, one **`Entry`** per segment) Lower Volume (下巻), Page 90, Line 4, Segment 1, **Character Order 1**.
* `Ta026241`: (Indicates the **first `Entry`** when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 26, Line 2, Segment 4, **Character Order 1**.
* `Ta026242`: (Indicates an **`Entry`** starting from the **2nd character position** within the segment, when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 26, Line 2, Segment 4, **Character Order 2**.
* `Ta030341`: (Indicates the **first `Entry`** when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 30, Line 3, Segment 4, **Character Order 1**.
* `Ta030343`: (Indicates an **`Entry`** starting from the **3rd character position** within the segment, when multiple **`Entries`** are in the segment) Upper Volume (上巻), Page 30, Line 3, Segment 4, **Character Order 3**.

**Purpose:**
To indicate the location of an **`Entry`** in the Tenri Edition. This ID system is determined based on rules for indicating character position, designed to accommodate all various arrangement patterns of **`Entries`**: the primarily used "single-segment, single-entry" arrangement; the frequently occurring "multi-segment, single-entry" arrangement; and the rare "single-segment, multi-entry" arrangement.

## Input Method for `Headwords`

**`Headwords`** are input into the `hanzi_entry` column.

**`Entries`** have **`Headwords`** that can be in either **`Single Character Form`** or **`Multi-Character Form`**. As the **`Single Character Form`** generally does not pose particular input issues, this section will focus on the input method for **`Headwords`** in **`Multi-Character Form`**.

For **`Multi-Character Form`** **`Headwords`**, whether they represent a co-listing of **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)** or an idiom/compound, the constituent characters of the **`Headword`** are input separated by a '／' (full-width slash, U+FF0F).

If a **`Headword`** in an **`Entry`** contains '／', this indicates that the **`Headword`** is in **`Multi-Character Form`**. The number of characters in such a **`Headword`** can be determined by the number of segments separated by the '／' (e.g., one slash results in two segments, indicating two characters).

**Examples:**

  * Co-listing of **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)**: 翛／倐／倏／翛β
  * Idiom/compound: 一／人

For details on how to input characters using Unicode, please refer to the [Character Encoding and Representation](/en/docs/krm/04-entry-input/04-02-char/) section.


### Handling of IDs in Data Representation

The main entry data for the *Myōgishō* (e.g., in `krm_main.tsv`) is published in TSV format.
This subsection explains how each ID is represented in the TSV files, with a particular focus on the representation rules for **`Multi-Character Form`** **`Entries`**.
While some explanations may overlap with those in other sections (such as "Detailed Format of Primary IDs," "Input Method for `Headwords`," and the section on `krm_headword_chars` which details individual headword characters and acts as a mapping table), this information is crucial for processing the TSV-formatted data and is therefore summarized again here.

**TSV Columns and Corresponding IDs:**

The primary TSV files store the following IDs in their respective columns:

  * `entry_id`: **`Entry`** ID (F-format)
  * `hanzi_id`: **`Headword`** Character ID (S-format)
  * `kazama_location`: Kazama Edition Location (K-format)
  * `tenri_location`: Tenri Edition Location (T-format)

IDs other than those listed above (e.g., the **`Headword`** Character IDs or location IDs for the second and subsequent characters within a multi-character **`Headword`**) are not directly stored in this primary file but can be referenced through a separate mapping table (`krm_headword_chars.tsv`).

**Data Representation Rules for `Multi-Character Form` `Entries`**

  * **`Multi-Character Form`** **`Headwords`** (such as those co-listing **`variant characters` (*itaiji*)** or representing idioms/compounds) are stored as a string in the `hanzi_entry` column, with constituent characters separated by a full-width slash ('／').
  * Regarding the representation of IDs, the main TSV row corresponding to a **`Multi-Character Form`** **`Entry`** displays only the IDs related to the **first character** of that **`Headword`**.
  * IDs (S-format, K-format, T-format) related to the second and subsequent characters that constitute the **`Headword`** are omitted from this main row.

**Example:**
Suppose there is an **`Entry`** with the **`Headword`** "AB" (composed of A + B), and their respective IDs are as follows:

  * **`Entry`** ID: F25121
  * **`Headword`** Character ID for A: S31590 (Kazama Edition Location: K08084411, Tenri Edition Location: Tc090411)
  * **`Headword`** Character ID for B: S31591 (Kazama Edition Location: K08084412, Tenri Edition Location: Tc090412)

When this **`Entry`** is represented in the TSV file, the main row would appear as follows (showing relevant columns only):

| entry_id | hanzi_id | hanzi_entry | kazama_location | tenri_location |
| :--------- | :--------- | :------------ | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| F25121     | S31590     | AB            | K08084411         | Tc090411         |

It can be seen that this row contains only the **`Entry`** ID, the **`Headword`** Character ID for the **first character**, the complete **`Headword`** string, and the location IDs for the **first character**.

### Deferring Detailed Headword Character Information to a Mapping Table

All of the following detailed information pertaining to **`Headword`** characters is deferred to the mapping table [`krm_headword_chars`](/en/docs/krm/02-data-overview/02-03-headword-chars/):

  * The complete list of more detailed location information (K-format, T-format) corresponding to each **`Headword`** Character ID (S-format).
  * The cropped image file name corresponding to each individual **`Headword`** character (S-format).

Users who require this information will need to consult `krm_headword_chars.tsv`.
