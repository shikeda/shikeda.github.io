# Entry Data Model


Regarding the Kanchi-in manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*:

First, under **`Entry Data Structure`**, we present the internal components of an **`Entry`** (such as **`Headword`**, **`Phonetic Gloss`**, and **`Japanese Native Reading`*(wakun)***) using specific examples (visual representations and transcriptions), and provide an abstracted and visualized diagram of the **`Entry`** structure.

Next, under **`Types of Entries`**, different kinds, such as basic **`Entries`** and supplementary **`Entries`**, are discussed.

Furthermore, under **`Concepts Related to Character Notation`**, **`script styles`** (書体, *shotai*), the **`standard of writing Chinese characters`** (字体, *jitai*), and the **`shapes of Chinese characters`** (字形, *jikei*), along with **`variant characters`** (異体字, *itaiji*) and graphically similar characters, are explained.

Finally, we cover the **`Entry Data Files`**, including their content, specific examples, and the methods used for publication and updates via GitHub.
