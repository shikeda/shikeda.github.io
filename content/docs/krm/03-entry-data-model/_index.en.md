# Entry Data Model

Regarding the Kanchi-in manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*:

First, under **Entry Data Structure**, we present the internal components of an entry (such as Headword, Phonetic Gloss, and *Wakun*) using specific examples (visual representations and transcriptions), and provide an abstracted and visualized diagram of the entry structure.

Next, under **Types of Entries**, different kinds, such as basic entries and supplementary entries, are discussed.

Furthermore, under **Concepts Related to Character Notation**, script styles, character types, character forms (glyphs), variant characters, and graphically similar characters are explained.

Finally, we cover the **Entry Data Files**, including their content, specific examples, and the methods used for publication and updates via GitHub.
