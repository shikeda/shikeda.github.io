## Manuscript Traditions

The extant manuscripts of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* fall into two distinct textual lineages: the original compilation and its later redactions.  
The sole surviving exemplar of the original compilation is held by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency, and this lineage is often referred to as the *gensenbon* (original compilation) tradition. The manuscript in question was introduced in 1950 as the *Zushoryō* manuscript (Library of Ancient Books manuscript).  
The redacted lineage, alternatively termed the *kaihenbon-kei* (redacted version lineage) or *Kōekibon* tradition, includes several known manuscripts: the Kanchi-in manuscript, the Kōzan-ji manuscript, the Renshō-in manuscript, the Sainen-ji manuscript, and the Hōbodai-in manuscript. Of these, only the Kanchi-in manuscript survives in complete form; the remaining examples are fragmentary or incomplete. The redacted tradition has been the subject of sustained scholarly inquiry since the Edo period, beginning with the work of Ban Nobutomo and others.

In Japanese scholarship, it is common practice to refer to individual manuscripts by appending *-bon* (meaning “copy” or “text”) to the name of the holding temple or institution—for example, *Kanchiin-bon*. In this paper, however, these will be referred to using the English term “manuscript” for clarity and consistency.

In contemporary scholarship, the work is frequently referred to in abbreviated form as the *Myōgishō*.

## Compiler

The compiler of the original compilation is presumed to have been a Buddhist scholar-monk affiliated with the Hossō school, or possibly trained in both the Hossō and Shingon traditions, though their identity remains unknown. The compiler of the redacted version is likewise unidentified but is generally believed to have been a Shingon scholar-monk. A long-standing theory attributing the work to Sugawara no Koreyoshi is now considered erroneous.

## Date of Compilation

The sole extant exemplar of the original compilation—the *Zushoryō* manuscript—is a fragment of a single fascicle categorized under the **Dharma section (*hōbu*)**, referring to one of the traditional Buddhist categories corresponding to the Three Jewels (*Buddha, Dharma, Sangha*).

Although it bears no colophon or scribal note, it is generally dated to the Insei (cloistered rule) period. The text makes reference to the monk *Eichō Sōzu* (Eichō, Bishop), who is known to have received the title *Sōzu* in 1081 (Eihō 1). Based on this and other circumstantial evidence, the work is believed to have been compiled by around the year 1000.

As for the redacted version, a manuscript from Kōzan-ji contains a marginal note in the hand of the Kōyasan monk *Genshō*, dated to 1178 (Jishō 2). Since this note corresponds to content found in the redacted *Ruiju Myōgishō*, it is inferred that the revised compilation had been completed by that time.

## Significance

The work lists Chinese characters both as individual graphs and compounds, accompanied by fanqie spellings, homophone glosses, katakana transcriptions for Sino-Japanese readings, literary Chinese definitions, native Japanese readings (*wakun*) in katakana, and annotations indicating orthographic variants such as “standard” and “popular” forms. Phonetic marks (*shōten*) are sometimes added to both the Sino-Japanese and native readings.

## Radical Structure

According to the Kanchi-in manuscript, the *Ruiju Myōgishō* is organized into 120 sections grouped under the three divisions of the Buddhist Triratna: Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧). Each division contains 40 sections based on semantic radicals. The table below presents the full list of radicals used, shown with their associated head characters (部首字).

**Buddha Division (仏)**  
(*Upper Volume*)  
1 人 2 彳 3 辵 4 匚 5 走 6 麦 7 一 8 丨 9 十 10 身  
(*Middle Volume*)  
11 耳 12 女 13 舌 14 口 15 目 16 鼻 17 見 18 日 19 田 20 肉

**Note on Organization:**  
The radical system employed in the *Ruiju Myōgishō* follows the structure of the *Yùpiān* (『玉篇』) compiled by Liang dynasty scholar Gu Yewang, which comprises 542 sections. Radicals of similar form were grouped together (e.g., integrating 彳 and 行 under a single radical), while those with fewer entries were consolidated into the final miscellaneous section (雑).  
Additionally, the ordering of radicals reflects both semantic grouping (e.g., parts of the body, food, clothing, animals, plants, etc.) and visual similarity of character shapes. For example, the 女 radical follows 耳, and 言 follows 冫, likely because the cursive or semi-cursive forms of 耳 and 言 resemble 女 and 冫, respectively.

## Number of Entries

The term *entry* refers to a unit consisting of both the headword and its accompanying original glosses. To provide a general sense of the scope of the *Ruiju Myōgishō*, we may look to the Kanchi-in manuscript for a representative overview. The following table presents a summary of the number of entries, the number of individual headwords, and the number of compound expressions found in each of the ten volumes, from the *Buddha (Upper)* through the *Sangha (Lower)* sections.

**Table: Number of Entries, Characters, and Compound Expressions by Volume (Kanchi-in Manuscript)**  
The following table summarizes the distribution of character entries across the ten volumes of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* as preserved in the Kanchi-in manuscript. The work is structured into three main sections—Buddha (仏), Dharma (法), and Sangha (僧)—each comprising multiple volumes. The entries are classified by the number of characters per expression (from single-character to seven or more), along with totals for entries, characters, and compound expressions.

| **Volume**       | **1-char** | **2-char** | **3-char** | **4-char** | **5-char** | **6-char** | **7+ char** | **Total Entries** | **Total Characters** | **Compound Expressions** |

## Sources

**Original Compilation**

The Zushoryō manuscript of the original compilation, though fragmentary and classified under the Hōbu-jō (Department of Dharma: Upper) section, is distinguished by its faithful citation of a wide range of texts, including bibliographic and authorial attributions. It is widely utilized as a vital source in the study of the history of the Japanese language.

The manuscript contains 3,657 entries in total, of which 951 are single-character headwords; the remainder are compound expressions. The majority of these compounds are derived from Buddhist glossaries such as Xuanying’s *Yiqiejing yinyi*, Shingō’s *Daihannyakyō onkun*, Chūzan’s *Myōhōrengekyō shakumon*, and works attributed to Cien.

Beyond Buddhist phonetic commentaries, many entries are drawn from classical lexica such as Gu Yewang’s *Yupian*, Kūkai’s *Tenrei banshō meigi*, Sugawara no Koreyoshi’s *Tōkyū setsuin*, and Minamoto no Shitagō’s *Wamyō ruijushō*.

The citations from these sources follow a fixed order of precedence: in semantic annotations written in literary Chinese, sacred Buddhist texts (*naiten*) are prioritized over secular Chinese or native Japanese texts (*geten*). The Japanese glosses (*wakun*) are based on annotated editions (*kuntenbon*) of secular literature. Diacritical tone marks (*shōten*) are applied with precision, offering valuable information about vocabulary and pitch accent in the Heian period. These tone marks also appear in the phonetic annotations of Chinese characters—such as *fanqie*, homophonic glosses, and katakana transcriptions—making the manuscript an important resource for the study of Sino-Japanese phonology.

**Revised Compilation**

The Kanchi-in manuscript of the revised compilation—also known as the **Kaihenbon** or **Kōekibon**—contains approximately 32,000 headword entries and about 34,000 Japanese native readings (*wakun*). Of these, roughly 10,000 *wakun* are annotated with diacritical tone marks (*shōten*). The names of authors and titles of cited sources found in the original compilation have been removed, and many of the semantic glosses in literary Chinese have likewise been omitted. *Wakun* originally recorded in *man’yōgana* have been replaced with katakana.

There is a substantial expansion of single-character entries. For items carried over from the original compilation, *wakun* have been added and reorganized; for new entries introduced in the revised version, a large number of *wakun* have been supplemented as well, resulting in a significantly enlarged corpus of Japanese glosses.

The annotations on graphic variants (*itaiji*), “standard” and “popular” forms (*sei/zoku*), and the phonetic readings of characters in both Han and Wu pronunciations constitute a major resource for the study of Japanese linguistic history.

Within each radical category, headword entries are often arranged either by visual similarity or according to the character ordering found in the *Yupian*—referred to here as the *Gyokuhen jijun-gun* (“Yupian character order groups”).

Although only the *Hōbu-jō* (Upper Dharma) section of the original compilation survives, comparison between the original and revised versions reveals the nature of additions and editorial changes. For sections no longer extant in the original compilation, it is possible to identify underlying textual sources by cross-referencing with the principal reference works that were extensively cited in the original. Of particular importance are frequently referenced texts such as *Yiqiejing yinyi*, *Tenrei banshō meigi*, and *Wamyō ruijushō*, all of which remain extant in complete form. These sources should be consistently consulted when interpreting the revised compilation.

## Facsimile

### Original Compilation

**Zushoryō Manuscript**  
Formerly held in the collection of the Shimizudani Kimiyasu family and currently preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency (*Kunai-chō Shoryōbu*), this manuscript was first published in 1950 as a facsimile edition titled *Zushoryōbon Ruiju Myōgishō*, retaining its original Japanese-style binding. The edition includes an introductory essay by Hashimoto Fumio and is available for viewing via the National Diet Library Digital Collections.

A Western-style bound edition was reissued in 1969, followed by a revised edition in 1976 featuring a complete set of indices—for sources, *kana* glosses, and Chinese characters—accompanied by commentary by Tsukishima Hiroshi, a *kana* index by Miyazawa Toshimasa, and a kanji index by Sakai Kenji.

The extant portion of the manuscript corresponds to the *Hōbu jōge* (“Upper” and “Lower” Dharma sections), specifically the upper volume (*jōsatsu*), which covers 20 radicals out of a total of 40 in this section. It is generally believed that the full compilation originally consisted of two volumes each for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha sections. The character “五” (“5”) inscribed in the upper right corner of the cover suggests that this volume was originally the fifth in the full six-volume set.

On March 26, 2025, a color version of the manuscript was made publicly available via the Shoryōbu Catalog and Image Database of the Archives and Mausolea Department.

### Revised Compilation

**Kanchi-in Manuscript**  
Originally housed at Tō-ji’s Kanchi-in, this complete manuscript—consisting of one volume of section headings and ten volumes of main text—is now preserved at the Tenri Central Library. According to colophons, it was copied by Jinen in 1241 (Ninji 2) and later recopied by Kenkei in 1251 (Kenchō 3).  
Several facsimile and reproduction editions exist. The commonly cited versions are listed below, followed by brief descriptions:

  - **Kichōtosho Edition (1937):** A collotype facsimile edition in its original format, published by the Kichōtosho Fukuseikai, with commentary by Yamada Yoshio. Available via the National Diet Library Digital Collections.

  - **Koten Zenshū Edition (1938–1940):** Reproduced using letterpress printing by the Nihon Koten Zenshū Kankōkai, including kana and kanji indexes edited by Masamune Atsuo.

  - **Kazama Edition (1954–1955):** Republished by Kazama Shobō with commentary by Nakada Norio. Volume 1 contains the main text; Volume 2 contains kanji and kana indexes. **Letterpress reproduction.** This is a convenient reference edition as the index locations correspond to its pagination.

  - **Old Tenri Edition (1976):** Reproduced with corrected foliation in Vols. 32–34 of the *Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho: Washo no Bu*, with commentary by Yoshida Kanehiko. Published by Tenri University Press and distributed by Yagi Shoten. Locations are cited using the original volume and folio numbers. Printed in monochrome using offset printing.

  - **New Tenri Edition (2018):** Published in Vols. 9–11 of the *Shin Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho*, based on high-resolution color photography taken after restoration, with commentary by Ōtsuki Makoto. Published by Tenri University Press and distributed by Yagi Shoten.  
    This edition includes references not only to the original volume and folio numbers, but also to the Old Tenri and Kazama Edition page numbers, enhancing its compatibility with the Kazama indexes.

**Renjōin Manuscript**  
Previously held at Kōfuku-ji’s Renjōin, this fragmentary manuscript (3 volumes) is now in the possession of Chinkoku Shukoku Shrine (Kuwana City, Mie Prefecture). Copied in the late Kamakura to early Muromachi period, it is also referred to as the Chinkoku Shukoku Shrine Manuscript.  
It comprises: Volume 1 (corresponding to *Butsu-jō* and *Butsu-chū* in the Kanchi-in Manuscript); Volume 2 (covering up to mid-*Hō-jō*); and Volume 3 (corresponding to *Sō*). A facsimile edition was issued in 1965 by the Mikkan Kokubun Shiryō Kankōkai under the title *Sanpō Ruiju Myōgishō*, with commentary by Ozaki Satoakira. A clearer reproduction was issued in 1986 by Benseisha.

**Kōsan-ji Manuscript**  
Formerly held at Kōsan-ji and now preserved at the Tenri Central Library via the Hōrei Collection. This manuscript was copied during the Insei period (late Heian).  
It consists of two fragmentary volumes corresponding to *Butsu-jō* and *Butsu-chū* of the Kanchi-in Manuscript. The first folio lists section headings under the title *Sanbō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō*, and the main text begins with *Butsuhō Ruiji-shū Kan-jō I / Section 1: Jin*. This corresponds to the entry in the *Kōsan-ji Shōgyō Mokuroku* (Kenchō Inventory), which records *Sanpō Ruiji-shū* as a six-volume work. In 2016, a high-resolution color facsimile was published as Vol. 8 of the *Shin Tenri Toshokan Zenpon Sōsho*, with commentary by Yamamoto Hideto.

**Sainen-ji Manuscript**  
A one-volume fragment transcribed in 1767 (Meiwa 4), based on the Eissatsu Manuscript, preserving portions of *Butsu-jō* and *Butsu-chū*. Now held by both the Tenri Central Library and Kansai University. Although no printed facsimile exists, images of the Kansai University copy are publicly available.  
A version preserved by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency is also accessible and more closely resembles the Tenri copy than the Kansai University one. While the Tenri copy has often been used in prior scholarship, the lack of a published facsimile once required researchers to visit the library to obtain photographic reproductions. The Shoryōbu copy now allows readers to access the same textual content as the Tenri Sainen-ji Manuscript.

**Hōbodai-in Manuscript**  
A one-volume fragment covering the “Ship” (舟) through “Dog” (犬) sections of *Butsu-ge* in the Kanchi-in Manuscript, likely copied in the late Kamakura period.  
A facsimile edition was published in 2002 by Taishō University Press, with commentary by Kurashima Tokihisa. A wakun index compiled by the same scholar was published in 2006 by the same press.
