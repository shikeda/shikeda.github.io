Under preparation.

This file compiles links to the images of the Kanchi-in manuscript of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* that are publicly available in the National Diet Library Digital Collections.

This data cross-references the locations within the Kanchi-in manuscript of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* with their corresponding URLs in the National Diet Library Digital Collections. The file name is `KRM_ndl.tsv`.



This data indicates the volume name, radical character, Kazama edition page number, Tenri edition page number, and the URL for the National Diet Library Digital Collections.

Next, a sample of the beginning of the data is shown below.

| 仏上   | 人       | 2      | 24    | https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2586891/7 |


We plan to make improvements to facilitate easier integration with `krm_main`.
