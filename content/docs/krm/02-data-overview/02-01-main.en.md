## Overview and file formats

This section describes the core files of the database for the Kanchi-in manuscript of the *Ruiju Mōgishō* (hereinafter "*Myōgishō*").

Previously, the released file was a TSV file named `KRM.tsv`.

It contains information regarding head characters, full definitions, volume, radical, and the locations in the Kazama edition and the Tenri edition.

In March 2025, the specifications for column names and the display method for tone marks were updated. To clearly indicate that it is the file with these updated specifications, it was renamed `krm_main.tsv`. A JSON version of this file has also been made available.


## Column name comparison

The correspondence between the old and new column names is as follows:


| New Column Name (v1.2.5) | Old Column Name (v1.1.347) |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| entry_id                 | KRID_n                     |
| hanzi_id                 | KRID_sn                    |
| -                        | KR2ID                      |
| kazama_location          | KRID                       |
| tenri_location           | KR_Tenri_p                 |
| volume_name              | KR_vol_name                |
| radical_name             | KR_radical                 |
| volume_radical_index     | KR_vol_radical             |
| hanzi_entry              | Entry                      |
| original_entry           | Entry_original             |
| definition               | Def                        |
| -                        | Remarks                    |

The `KR2ID` column was omitted, and the `kazama_location` column was aligned with the `KRID` column.

The `Remarks` column was omitted and will be summarized in the following `krm_notes` file.


## Description of each column


Next, the content of the column names will be explained.

| New Column Name (v1.2.5) | Explanation          |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| entry_id                 | A heading item ID formed by a 5-digit numeric ID starting with 'F'. For some added entry items, a 'b' suffix is appended.     |
| hanzi_id                 | A heading Hanzi ID consisting of a 5-digit numeric ID starting with 'S'. For some added entry items, a 'b' suffix is appended.   |
| kazama_location    | An ID indicating K + Volume (2 digits) + Kazama Edition Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character order (字順, *jijun*) (1 digit). Details of the rules for assigning Character order are defined separately.  |
| tenri_location           | An ID indicating T + Volume (a/b/c) + Tenri Edition Page (3 digits) + Line (1 digit) + Segment (1 digit) + Character order (字順, *jijun*) (1 digit). Details of the rules for assigning Character order are defined separately. |
| volume_name              | Name of the volume, consisting of 10 volumes: 仏上, 仏中, 仏末本, 仏末下, 法上, 法中, 法下, 僧上, 僧中, and 僧下.      |
| radical_name             | Hanzi name of the radical, consisting of 160 radicals ranging from 人 to 雑, used to classify Hanzi characters.   |
| volume_radical_index     | Volume and radical number, ranging from v1#1 to v10#120, indicating the location of the entry within the text. |
| hanzi_entry              | The collated headword characters principally use Kangxi Dictionary form, including Unicode simplified characters (common-use forms, popular variants). For characters not included in Unicode, they are represented by the following methods: If representable by combining kanji components, input using IDS (Ideographic Description Sequence). For specific kanji or their components, if representation by IDS or standard Unicode is difficult, use simplified notations based on the entity reference systems of CHISE and GlyphWiki (e.g., CDP-8C55, koseki-00001). Characters not representable by any of the above methods, or characters unreadable in the original text (worm-eaten, etc.), are input as '■' (black square). Headwords consisting of multiple kanji are separated by '／' (full-width slash). The abbreviation symbol '｜' is indicated by 'ー' (long vowel mark), and the corresponding character is appended in full-width parentheses (). |
| original_entry           | Headword based on the original character form. Errors are left as is. The representation of kanji outside Unicode follows the rules for hanzi_entry. If the original-form headword is not needed, '〇' is used. |
| definition               | Includes glyph annotations, pronunciation annotations, meaning annotations, Japanese readings (*wakun*), and other relevant notes, separated by spaces. As a general rule, character forms included in the "Kangxi Dictionary style" should be used.  |
