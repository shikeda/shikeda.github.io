The **`Definition (Original Glosses)`** in the *Myōgishō* is composed not only of **`Japanese Native Readings (*wakun*)`** but also other elements such as **`Notes on Character Form`**, **`Phonetic Glosses`**, and **`Semantic Glosses in Chinese`**.

The `KRM_definitions.tsv` file, which was previously released, provided these elements of the **`Definition (Original Glosses)`** categorized by type and ordered by their appearance. This dataset was created to facilitate collation and source investigation.

Following the specification changes implemented in March 2025, the data and functionalities previously found in `KRM_definitions.tsv` have been integrated into the `krm_notes` file (which contains data for **`Compiler's Remarks`** and detailed analyses of these original gloss elements). Consequently, a separate detailed explanation for `krm_definitions` is omitted here.
