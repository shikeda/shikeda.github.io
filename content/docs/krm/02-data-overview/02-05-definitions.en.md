The definitions in the *Myōgishō* include not only wakun but also elements such as glyph annotations, pronunciation annotations, and meaning annotations.

This file contains records created by categorizing each element of the definitions according to their order of appearance, assigning them numbers based on this order, and classifying the types of definitions. This was done for the purpose of collation and textual research.

The file previously made public was `KRM_definitions.tsv`.

After the specification change in March 2025, this information has been integrated into `krm_notes`, so a separate explanation will be omitted here.
