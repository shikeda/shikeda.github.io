# Basic Principles for Creating Annotations/Commentary

The scholarly apparatus for the *Myōgishō* in this database includes elements such as **`Textual Collation`** (*kōkan*), **`Source Criticism`** (*shutten kōshō*, 出典考証), **`Review of Previous Scholarship`** (*kenkyūshi seiri*), **`Lexical Analysis`** (*goshaku*), and **`Additional Expositions`** (*yosetsu*). The content of each is explained as follows:

* **`Textual Collation`** (校勘, *kōkan*): Involves presenting textual variants by comparing the *Myōgishō* text with the main texts of other manuscripts and with fragmentary textual evidence (逸文, *itsubun*), conducting comparative analyses, correcting scribal errors, and reconstructing the original text.
* **`Source Criticism`** (出典考証, *shutten kōshō*): Entails searching for original sources cited in the *Myōgishō*, analyzing citation methods, and clarifying distinctions between direct and indirect (second-hand) citations.
* **`Review of Previous Scholarship`** (研究史整理, *kenkyūshi seiri*): Summarizes and introduces the views and findings of previous scholars.
* **`Lexical Analysis`** (語釈, *goshaku*): Consists of philological analysis concerning semantic meanings, phonology, and orthography of words and characters.
* **`Additional Expositions`** (余説, *yosetsu*): These are the annotator's (i.e., the database compiler's) own detailed discussions and considerations based on the analysis of specific **`Entries`** or elements within them.

Ideally, annotations should be concise and clear. However, as a preliminary step, it is necessary to gather as much relevant material as possible for a given annotation. Only after this preparatory stage is complete can the work of selecting and refining the collected materials begin.

The materials collected to date are recorded as **`Compiler's Remarks`** in the `remarks` column of the `krm_notes` file.

In this document, we will first classify the **`Entries`** of the *Myōgishō* by their **`Headwords`** and the various types of **`Original Glosses`** they contain, and then present the quantities for each category. Based on this, we will consider the priority for creating annotations for each type of **`Headword`** and each category of **`Original Gloss`** element, focusing our primary analytical efforts on **`Japanese Native Readings` (*wakun*)** and **`Phonetic Glosses`**. This will clarify the **basic principles for annotation creation and the primary subjects of analysis**.

Next, we will provide and explain specific examples of scribal errors, omissions, and superfluous characters (衍字, *enji*). We will also describe how such information is recorded in the **`Compiler's Remarks`** and conduct a **calculation of the number of `Headword` characters**.

For **`Notes on Character Form`** (字体注, *jitaichū*), we will organize their **types and descriptive formats**. By clarifying the content and format of these original notes, we aim to minimize the need for extensive commentary on them within the **`Compiler's Remarks`**.

Regarding **`Semantic Glosses in Chinese`** (義注, *gichū*), we will indicate their **types and quantities**, and introduce examples of such glosses that have been mistakenly identified as katakana.

For **`Japanese Native Readings`** (和訓, *wakun*), given the extensive body of previous research, we will provide a list of these studies and the abbreviations used for them in the **`Compiler's Remarks`**. This will serve as an introduction to the **foundational materials for annotating *wakun***.

Finally, using page 62 of the *Butsujō* (仏上) volume of the Kanchi-in manuscript of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* as a **specific example of annotation practice**, we will introduce the content of the **`Compiler's Remarks`**. This will demonstrate how subtle differences in **`Hanzi (Chinese character)`** glyph forms can be explained in the annotations through the use of GlyphWiki.
