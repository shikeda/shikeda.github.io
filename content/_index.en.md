# HDIC Project

## What is HDIC?

The "H" in HDIC is a combination of the "H" from Heian (平安時代), the "H" from Hanzi (漢字), and the "H" from Hokkaido University (北海道大学), the representative's affiliated institution.

The project to construct and publish the HDIC database is called the HDIC Project. This HDIC Project is being carried out with support from a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The grant numbers are 16H03422, 19H00526, and 23K17500.

At the inception of the HDIC Project, the 'Steering Committee for Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan' was established on February 13, 2014, to serve as the project's core entity. The representative was Shōju Ikeda (then a professor in the Graduate School of Humanities and Human Sciences at Hokkaido University).

Representative Ikeda retired from Hokkaido University at the end of March 2021. Currently, as an Emeritus Professor of Hokkaido University, he is continuing this project.

## Text and Annotations

The purpose of this website is to provide information concerning the main text and annotations of the Kanchi-in manuscript ***Ruiju Myōgishō*** (hereafter ***Myōgishō***), included in the HDIC collection.

The main text presented here is a complete transcription of all entry characters and their associated glosses found within the ***Myōgishō***. The annotations consist of collation, source research, and other relevant information added to this transcribed text. We have aimed to comprehensively cite previous studies and have focused on highlighting points requiring special attention regarding character forms, phonetic glosses, semantic glosses, and *wakun* (Japanese native readings, or *kun'yomi*). Regarding *wakun*, correspondence with entries in the JapanKnowledge edition of the *Nihon Kokugo Daijiten, Second Edition* is also indicated.

### The Editorial Committee of HDIC Database Project

The Editorial Committee of HDIC Database Project, was founded for the purpose of compiling an unified database of early Japanese dictionaries, named the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (abbreviated as HDIC).
The Database includes,

1. Kōsan-ji manuscript *Tenrei Banshō Meigi*
2. Tenji manuscript *Shinsen Jikyō*
3. Zushoryō manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*
4. Kanchi-in manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*

We are currently inputting the headwords and annotation text of these Hanzi Dictionaries, in order to construct an inquiry system. By opening this system to the public, we intend to make a significant contribution to the development of academic research.
A sub-database of dictionaries, compiled in China, including,

5. Original *Yupian* manuscript fragment(s)
6. Song edition *Yupian (Daguang Yihui Yupian)*
7. Goryeo edition *Longkan Shoujing*

is also being independently constructed by the research group.
The headwords are being processed in two ways. One is to input the headwords using the computer-readable characters, and the other is to cut a picture of each head word down from a photocopy of the original books. The annotation text, which refers to the pronunciation, meaning and variants of each headword, is inputted using computer-readable text.
