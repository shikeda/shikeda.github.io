# HDIC Project

## What is HDIC?

The "H" in HDIC is a combination of the "H" from Heian (平安時代), the "H" from Hanzi (漢字), and the "H" from Hokkaido University (北海道大学), the representative's affiliated institution.

The project to construct and publish the HDIC database is called the HDIC Project. This HDIC Project is being carried out with support from a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. The grant numbers are 16H03422, 19H00526, and 23K17500.

At the inception of the HDIC Project, the 'Steering Committee for Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan' was established on February 13, 2014, to serve as the project's core entity. The representative was Shōju Ikeda (then a professor in the Graduate School of Humanities and Human Sciences at Hokkaido University).

Representative Ikeda retired from Hokkaido University at the end of March 2021. Currently, as an Emeritus Professor of Hokkaido University, he is continuing this project.

## The Myōgishō Text and Commentary

The purpose of this website is to provide a complete transcription of the main text of the Kanchi-in manuscript of the *Ruiju Myōgishō* (hereafter *Myōgishō*), and to offer various explanations regarding its content in the form of a **Commentary**.

The main text of the *Myōgishō* consists of a collection of **Entries**. Each **Entry** is composed of a **Headword** and what is referred to in this database as **Definition** (representing the original glosses from the manuscript). This **Definition** (original glosses) is further comprised of elements such as **Notes on Character Form**, **Phonetic Gloss**, **Semantic Gloss in Chinese**, **Japanese Native Reading**, and **Other** information.

As an analysis of these **Headwords** and the various elements within the **Definition** (original glosses), **Compiler's Remarks** are provided by the creators of this database.

The **Commentary** in this database, therefore, consists of two primary components: the **Original Glosses** found in the source text of the *Myōgishō* and the **Compiler's Remarks** on these original elements. Users of this database are advised to pay particular attention to this two-part structure of the Commentary.

Specifically, the **Original Glosses** from the *Myōgishō* source (which are conceptually the "original annotations") are stored in the database's `definition` column under the field name **Definition**. The **Compiler's Remarks** on these elements are stored in the `remarks` column.

### The Editorial Committee of HDIC Database Project

The Editorial Committee of HDIC Database Project, was founded for the purpose of compiling an unified database of early Japanese dictionaries, named the Integrated Database of Hanzi Dictionaries in Early Japan (abbreviated as HDIC).
The Database includes,

1. Kōsan-ji manuscript *Tenrei Banshō Meigi*
2. Tenji manuscript *Shinsen Jikyō*
3. Zushoryō manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*
4. Kanchi-in manuscript *Ruiju Myōgishō*

We are currently inputting the headwords and annotation text of these Hanzi Dictionaries, in order to construct an inquiry system. By opening this system to the public, we intend to make a significant contribution to the development of academic research.
A sub-database of dictionaries, compiled in China, including,

5. Original *Yupian* manuscript fragment(s)
6. Song edition *Yupian (Daguang Yihui Yupian)*
7. Goryeo edition *Longkan Shoujing*

is also being independently constructed by the research group.
The headwords are being processed in two ways. One is to input the headwords using the computer-readable characters, and the other is to cut a picture of each head word down from a photocopy of the original books. The annotation text, which refers to the pronunciation, meaning and variants of each headword, is inputted using computer-readable text.
